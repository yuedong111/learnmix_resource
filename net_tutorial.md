1. Getting Ready 
Section Owner: Ajay Varghese (MVP)
Content Contributors: Bipin Joshi (MVP)
Welcome friends to the exciting journey of Microsoft .NET. If you are looking for 
information about what .NET is all about, what it can do for you or how it can help you 
and your customers, you have come to the right place. This section is intended to tell you 
about these and many more things. After covering this section you will be ready to delve 
into details of .NET. 
The section is divided into following sub-sections: 
1) Tracing the .NET History 
2) Flavors of .NET 
3) Features of .NET  
4) Installing .NET Framework SDK 
The first sub-section will introduce you with how .NET evolved and the path of .NET 
since its Beta releases.  
The second sub-section will introduce you with various flavors of...NET and their 
respective SDKs. It also gives overview of Visual Studio.NET – an excellent IDE for 
developing .NET applications. 
It is necessary to understand the features of .NET that make it robust, programmer 
friendly, powerful and flexible. The third sub-section is intended just for that. It gives 
overview of technical features that make .NET shine over traditional programming 
environments. 
The final sub-section tells you how to install .NET framework SDK, what are the system 
requirements and related topics. 
1.1 Tracing the .NET History 
Sometime in the July 2000, Microsoft announced a whole new software development 
framework for Windows called .NET in the Professional Developer Conference (PDC). 
Microsoft also released PDC version of the software for the developers to test. After 
initial testing and feedback Beta 1 of .NET was announced. Beta 1 of the .NET itself got 
lot of attention from the developer community. When Microsoft announced Beta 2, it 
incorporated many changes suggested by the community and internals into the software. 
The overall ‘Beta’ phase lasted for more than 1 ½ years. Finally, in March 2002 
Microsoft released final version of the .NET framework.  
One thing to be noted here is the change in approach of Microsoft while releasing this 
new platform. Unlike other software where generally only a handful people are involved 
in beta testing, .NET was thrown open to community for testing in it’s every pre-release 
version. This is one of the reasons why it created so many waves of excitement within the 
community and industry as well. 
Microsoft has put in great efforts in this new platform. In fact Microsoft says that its 
future depends on success of .NET. The development of .NET is such an important event 
that Microsoft considers it equivalent to transition from DOS to Windows. All the future 
development – including new and version upgrades of existing products – will revolve 
around .NET. So, if you want to be at the forefront of Microsoft Technologies, you 
should be knowing .NET! 
Now, that we know about brief history of .NET let us see what .NET has to offer.  
1.2 Flavors of .NET 
Contrary to general belief .NET is not a single technology. Rather it is a set of 
technologies that work together seamlessly to solve your business problems. The 
following sections will give you insight into various flavors and tools of .NET and what 
kind of applications you can develop. 
• What type of applications can I develop? 
When you hear the name .NET, it gives a feeling that it is something to do only 
with internet or networked applications. Even though it is true that .NET provides 
solid foundation for developing such applications it is possible to create many 
other types of applications. Following list will give you an idea about various 
types of application that we can develop on .NET. 
1. ASP.NET Web applications: These include dynamic and data driven browser 
based applications. 
2. Windows Form based applications: These refer to traditional rich client 
applications. 
3. Console applications: These refer to traditional DOS kind of applications like 
batch scripts. 
4. Component Libraries: This refers to components that typically encapsulate 
some business logic. 
5. Windows Custom Controls: As with traditional ActiveX controls, you can 
develop your own windows controls. 
6. Web Custom Controls: The concept of custom controls can be extended to 
web applications allowing code reuse and modularization. 
7. Web services: They are “web callable” functionality available via industry 
standards like HTTP, XML and SOAP. 
8. Windows Services: They refer to applications that run as services in the 
background. They can be configured to start automatically when the system 
boots up. 
As you can clearly see, .NET is not just for creating web application but for 
almost all kinds of applications that you find under Windows. 
• .NET Framework SDK 
You can develop such varied types of applications. That’s fine.  But how? As with 
most of the programming languages, .NET has a complete Software Development 
Kit (SDK) - more commonly referred to as .NET Framework SDK - that 
provides classes, interfaces and language compilers necessary to program for 
.NET.  Additionally it contains excellent documentation and Quick Start tutorials 
that help you learn .NET technologies with ease. Good news is that - .NET 
Framework SDK is available FREE of cost. You can download it from the MSDN 
web site. This means that if you have machine with .NET Framework installed 
and a text editor such as Notepad then you can start developing for .NET right 
now! 
You can download entire .NET Framework SDK (approx 131 Mb) from MSDN 
web site at  
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url
=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml
• Development Tools 
If you are developing applications that require speedy delivery to your customers 
and features like integration with some version control software then simple 
Notepad may not serve your purpose. In such cases you require some Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE) that allows for Rapid Action Development 
(RAD). The new Visual Studio.NET is such an IDE. VS.NET is a powerful and 
flexible IDE that makes developing .NET applications a breeze. Some of the 
features of VS.NET that make you more productive are: - -- - - - 
Drag and Drop design 
 IntelliSense features 
Syntax highlighting and auto-syntax checking 
Excellent debugging tools 
Integration with version control software such as Visual Source Safe (VSS) 
Easy project management 
Note that when you install Visual Studio.NET, .NET Framework is automatically 
installed on the machine. 
• Visual Studio.NET Editions 
Visual Studio.NET comes in different editions. You can select edition appropriate 
for the kind of development you are doing. Following editions of VS.NET are 
available: -
 Professional - Enterprise Developer - Enterprise Architect 
Visual Studio .NET Professional edition offers a development tool for 
creating various types of applications mentioned previously. Developers can 
use Professional edition to build Internet and Develop applications quickly 
and create solutions that span any device and integrate with any platform. 
Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Developer (VSED) edition contains all the 
features of Professional edition plus has additional capabilities for enterprise 
development. The features include things such as a collaborative team 
development, Third party tool integration for building XML Web services and 
built-in project templates with architectural guidelines and spanning 
comprehensive project life-cycle. 
Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect (VSEA) edition contains all the 
features of Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Developer edition and additionally 
includes capabilities for designing, specifying, and communicating application 
architecture and functionality. The additional features include Visual designer 
for XML Web services, Unified Modeling Language (UML) support and 
enterprise templates for development guidelines and policies. 
A complete comparison of these editions can be found at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/howtobuy/choosing.asp
In addition to these editions, special language specific editions are available. They 
are: - - - 
Visual Basic.NET Standard Edition 
Visual C# Standard Edition 
Visual C++ .NET Standard (soon to be released) 
These editions are primarily for hobbyist, student, or beginner who wants to 
try their hands on basic language features. 
A complete comparison of these standard editions with professional edition of 
VS.NET can be found at: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/howtobuy/choosing.asp
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/howtobuy/choosing.asp
• .NET Redistributable 
In order to run application developed using .NET Framework the machine must 
have certain ‘runtime’ files installed. They are collectively called as .NET 
redistributable. This is analogous to traditional Visual Basic applications that 
required Visual Basic runtime installed on target computers. .NET redistributable 
provides one redistributable installer that contains the common language runtime 
(more on that later) and Microsoft .NET Framework components that are 
necessary to run .NET Framework applications. The redistributable is available as 
a stand-alone executable and can be installed manually or as a part of your 
application setup. 
You can download .NET redistributable at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url
=/msdn-files/027/001/829/msdncompositedoc.xml
More technical information about .NET redistributable can be found at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en
us/dnnetdep/html/dotnetfxref.asp
Note that if you have installed .NET Framework SDK, there is no need of 
installing redistributable separately. Also, note that there is difference between 
.NET Framework SDK and .NET redistributable in terms of purpose and tools 
and documentation supplied. .NET Framework SDK is intended to ‘develop’ 
applications where as .NET redistributable is intended to ‘run’ .NET applications. 
• .NET and mobile development 
Now days the use of mobile and wireless devices is ever increasing. PDAs, 
mobile phones, Smartphones, handheld PCs and HTML pagers are becoming 
common. As compared to full blown desktop computers, Mobile devices are 
generally resource-constrained. There are limitations on what they can display 
and in which form. For example you can easily display graphical menus in 
desktop applications but the same may not be possible for cell phones.  
Today there are many vendors making CPUs and development tools for mobile 
devices. However, their standards are much varying. For example devices running 
Windows CE will have different tools and standards of development than Palm 
OS. Also, programming model for such devices is an issue of debate. For 
example, Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) was considered a ‘standard’ for 
mobile devices but it introduced disadvantages of its own such as requirement of 
continuous connectivity, lack in rich user interface and failure to utilize client 
side resources effectively. 
Mobile devices can be broadly divided into two categories: 
1) Mobile Devices that have certain client-side resources like PDAs, 
Smartphones and Handheld PCs. They can run stand-alone application with 
rich user interface. 
2) Mobile Devices that lack even these client-side resources such as mobile 
phones. They can not run stand alone applications having rich and more 
interactive user interface. 
In order to encompass all possible devices from above categories Microsoft has 
developed two distinct technologies namely: - - 
Microsoft .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 
Microsoft Mobile Internet Toolkit (MMIT) 
o 
o 
Microsoft .NET Compact Framework 
.NET compact framework is a sub set of entire .NET framework and is 
targeted at mobile devices having some client side resources. It provides 
support for managed code and XML Web services.  Currently, .NET 
Compact Framework is in Beta 1 and is available on devices running the 
Windows CE or Windows CE .NET operating systems. However, 
Microsoft has promised support for other platforms in the future. As of 
now the framework supports Visual Basic.NET and C# as development 
languages out of the box. Support for other languages is planned in near 
future. 
Microsoft is creating a set of extensions for Visual Studio .NET called 
Smart Device Extensions that will allow Visual Studio .NET developers to 
program for .NET Compact Framework.  This means that developers 
familiar with Visual Studio.NET can start developing for mobile devices 
almost instantly. 
More information about .NET Compact Framework can be obtained at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/device/compact.asp
Microsoft Mobile Internet Toolkit 
Microsoft Mobile Internet Toolkit (MMIT) is designed to develop server 
side applications for mobile devices such as cell phones, PDAs, and 
pagers. It is different than .NET compact Framework in that it is a server 
side technology. It is ideal for devices that can not run stand alone 
applications.   
MMIT mainly uses ASP.NET as a technology for delivering markup to a 
wide variety of mobile devices. As we know that each mobile device has 
its own set of underlying standards and markup. MMIT shields these 
details from the developer and allows ‘uniform code’ for any target 
device. Based on the capabilities of target device the output is rendered. 
More information about MMIT can be obtained from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/device/mitdefault.asp
1.3 Features of .NET  
Now that we know some basics of .NET, let us see what makes .NET a wonderful 
platform for developing modern applications. 
• Rich Functionality out of the box 
.NET framework provides a rich set of functionality out of the box. It contains 
hundreds of classes that provide variety of functionality ready to use in your 
applications. This means that as a developer you need not go into low level details 
of many operations such as file IO, network communication and so on. 
• Easy development of web applications 
ASP.NET is a technology available on .NET platform for developing dynamic 
and data driven web applications. ASP.NET provides an event driven 
programming model (similar to Visual Basic 6 that simplify development of web 
pages (now called as web forms) with complex user interface. ASP.NET server 
controls provide advanced user interface elements (like calendar and grids) that 
save lot of coding from programmer’s side. 
• OOPs Support 
The advantages of Object Oriented programming are well known. .NET provides 
a fully object oriented environment. The philosophy of .NET is – “Object is 
mother of all.” Languages like Visual Basic.NET now support many of the OO 
features that were lacking traditionally. Even primitive types like integer and 
characters can be treated as objects – something not available even in OO 
languages like C++.  
• Multi-Language Support  
Generally enterprises have varying skill sets. For example, a company might have 
people with skills in Visual Basic, C++, and Java etc. It is an experience that 
whenever a new language or environment is invented existing skills are outdated. 
This naturally increases cost of training and learning curve. .NET provides 
something attractive in this area. It supports multiple languages. This means that 
if you have skills in C++, you need not throw them but just mould them to suit 
.NET environment. Currently four languages are available right out of the box 
namely – Visual Basic.NET, C# (pronounced as C-sharp), Jscript.NET and 
Managed C++ (a dialect of Visual C++). There are many vendors that are 
working on developing language compilers for other languages (20+ language 
compilers are already available). The beauty of multi language support lies in the 
fact that even though the syntax of each language is different, the basic 
capabilities of each language remain at par with one another. 
• Multi-Device Support 
Modern lift style is increasingly embracing mobile and wireless devices such as 
PDAs, mobiles and handheld PCs. . . .NET provides promising platform for 
programming such devices. .NET Compact Framework and Mobile Internet 
Toolkit are step ahead in this direction. 
• Automatic memory management 
While developing applications developers had to develop an eye on system 
resources like memory. Memory leaks were major reason in failure of 
applications. .NET takes this worry away from developer by handling memory on 
its own. The garbage collector takes care of freeing unused objects at appropriate 
intervals. 
• Compatibility with COM and COM+ 
Before the introduction of .NET, COM was the de-facto standard for 
componentized software development. Companies have invested lot of money and 
efforts in developing COM components and controls. The good news is – you can 
still use COM components and ActiveX controls under .NET. This allows you to 
use your existing investment in .NET applications. .NET still relies on COM+ for 
features like transaction management and object pooling. In fact it provides 
enhanced declarative support for configuring COM+ application right from your 
source code. Your COM+ knowledge still remains as a valuable asset. 
• No more DLL Hell 
If you have worked with COM components, you probably are aware of “DLL 
hell”. DLL conflicts are a common fact in COM world. The main reason behind 
this was the philosophy of COM – “one version of component across machine”. 
Also, COM components require registration in the system registry. .NET ends this 
DLL hell by allowing applications to use their own copy of dependent DLLs. 
Also, .NET components do not require any kind of registration in system registry. 
• Strong XML support 
Now days it is hard to find a programmer who is unaware of XML. XML has 
gained such a strong industry support that almost all the vendors have released 
some kind of upgrades or patches to their existing software to make it “XML 
compatible”. Currently, .NET is the only platform that has built with XML right 
into the core framework. .NET tries to harness power of XML in every possible 
way. In addition to providing support for manipulating and transforming XML 
documents, .NET provides XML web services that are based on standards like 
HTTP, XML and SOAP. 
• Ease of deployment and configuration 
Deploying windows applications especially that used COM components were 
always been a tedious task. Since .NET does not require any registration as such, 
much of the deployment is simplified. This makes XCOPY deployment viable. 
Configuration is another area where .NET – especially ASP.NET – shines over 
traditional languages. The configuration is done via special files having special 
XML vocabulary. Since, most of the configuration is done via configuration files, 
there is no need to sit in front of actual machine and configure the application 
manually. This is more important for web applications; simply FTPing new 
configuration file makes necessary changes. 
• Security 
Windows platform was always criticized for poor security mechanisms. Microsoft 
has taken great efforts to make .NET platform safe and secure for enterprise 
applications. Features such as type safety, code access security and role based 
authentication make overall application more robust and secure. 
1.4 Installing the .NET Framework SDK 
Now that you have fare idea of what .NET I and what it can do for you, it is time to 
install .NET framework SDK on your machine. Following sections will tell you 
everything you need to know for installing .NET framework. 
• Hardware Requirements 
In order to install .NET framework SDK following hardware is required: - - - - -

want to run ASP.NET)  
o 
Microsoft Windows NT® 4.0  
Note: If you want to simply run .NET applications then you can also run them on 
Microsoft Windows XP Home edition, Windows Millennium Edition (Windows 
ME) and Windows 98. 
Here are some URLs that you will find handy in making your system up-to-date 
for above software requirements. 
Internet Explorer 6 can be downloaded from 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/ie6/default.asp
Microsoft Data Access Components 2.7 can be downloaded from 
http://www.microsoft.com/data/download_270RTM.htm
Various Windows service packs and patches can be obtained from 
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.asp
• Where to get .NET Framework SDK 
As mentioned earlier .NET framework SDK is freely downloadable from MSDN 
site. Visit 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url
=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml
 and download it now. 
The total download size is 137,363,456 bytes (approximately 131 Mb). For your 
convenience Microsoft has provided multi-part version of the entire download. If 
you are unable to download the SDK from MSDN web site, check out popular PC 
magazines around. Many of them contain .NET Framework SDK on their 
companion CD. 
• Starting the installation 
Note: If you already have a previous version of .NET installed on the machine 
then it must first be uninstalled. Refer ReadMe files that ship with .NET 
framework SDK. These files contain valuable information related to installation, 
system requirements and trouble shooting. 
In order to start the installation, you need to run the setup program that is 
available with the download mentioned above. A wizard will guide you with 
necessary process. It will also allow you to select various components of the 
framework.  
After the installation is complete it is a good idea to apply .NET framework 
Service pack 1. The service pack fixes some of the bugs. It can be downloaded 
from: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/sp1/default.asp
• Installing Samples and Quick Start Tutorials 
.NET framework comes with an excellent set of tutorials that help you learn 
various technologies such as ASP.NET and windows forms. In order to configure 
the tutorials follow Start menu -> Program -> Microsoft .NET Framework SDK  -> Samples and Quick Start Tutorials. This will open up a HTML document that 
will guide you through the process of configuring the samples and tutorials. 
• Installing MSDE 
.NET framework samples and quick start tutorials require a Microsoft SQL Server 
Desktop Engine (MSDE). MSDE is scaled down version of SQL Server. The 
samples use databases from the MSDE. In order to work with the samples make 
sure you have started an instance of MSDE. You can use this MSDE for creating 
your own databases for testing applications. 
Coming Next… 
By the time you must have got idea about what .NET is and what it can do for you. You 
probably will have installed .NET on your machine waiting eagerly to try hands on it. 
However, before you go into the code level details, it is essential that you firmly 
understand certain fundamentals. In the next section we will demystify some intrinsic 
concepts and features of .NET framework. 
2. Introduction to the .NET Initiative and the .NET 
Platform 
Section Owner: Saurabh Nandu (MVP)
Content Contributors: Balachandran
, Pradeep
The Microsoft .NET initiative is a very wide initiative and it spans multiple Microsoft 
Products ranging from the Windows OS to the Developer Tools to the Enterprise Servers. 
The definition of .NET differs from context to context, and it becomes very difficult for 
you to interpret the .NET strategy. This section aims at demystifying the various 
terminologies behind .NET from a developer’s perspective. It will also highlight the need 
for using this new .NET Platform in your applications and how .NET improves over its 
previous technologies. 
2.1 Understanding the Existing Development Scenario 
Windows DNA is a concept for building distributed applications using the Microsoft 
Windows operating system and related software products. 
First we will understand about the 2- tier, 3- tier and then move on to N- tier Windows 
DNA. 
Why to divide an application into logical layers? 
Factoring an application into logical parts is useful. Breaking a large piece of software 
into smaller pieces can make it easier to build, easier to reuse and easier to modify. It can 
also be helpful in accommodating different technologies or different business 
organizations.  
2-Tier: Client Server

System 
Fig  Showing  2 – Tier Client Server Model 
Through the appearance of Local-Area-Networks, PCs came out of their isolation, and 
were soon not only being connected mutually but also to servers. Client/Server
computing was born. A two-tiered application is an application whose functionality can 
only be segmented into two logical tiers, presentation services and data services. The 
presentation services of a two-tiered application are responsible for gathering information 
from the user, interacting with the data services to perform the application's business 
operations, and presenting the results of those operations to the user. The Presentation 
services are also called the presentation layer because it presents information to the user. 
Things you might find in a presentation layer include a Web browser, a terminal, a 
custom-designed GUI, or even a character-based user interface. Client-Server 
architecture was a major buzzword in the early 90's, taking initially dumb terminal 
applications and giving them a fancy windows-like front end, using PCs with terminal 
emulators which presented pretty GUIs (Graphical user interface) or later Visual Basic 
etc front-ends. A web browser talking to a web server is an example of a client talking to 
a server. Here there is presentation logic (presentation tier) happening at the client, and 
data/file access (data access tier) and logic happening at the server. One reason why the 
2-tier model is so widespread is because of the quality of the tools and middleware that 
have been most commonly used since the 90’s: Remote-SQL, ODBC, relatively 
inexpensive and well-integrated PC-tools (like Visual Basic, Power-Builder, MS Access, 
4-GL-Tools by the DBMS manufactures). In comparison the server side uses relatively 
expensive tools. In addition the PC-based tools show good Rapid-Application
Development (RAD) qualities i.e. simpler applications can be produced in a 
comparatively short time. The 2-tier model is the logical consequence of the RAD-tools’ 
popularity.

Fig  Showing  3 – Tier or N- Tier Client Server Model 
In a three-tiered application, the presentation services are responsible for gathering 
information from the user, sending the user information to the business services for 
processing, receiving the results of the business services processing, and presenting those 
results to the user. The most popular architecture on the web currently, mostly taking the 
form of web browser processing client side presentation in the form of HTML/DHTML, 
etc, the web server using some scripting language (ASP) and the database server (SQL 
Server for example) serving up the data.  
The basic functionalities of  3 – Tier or N-Tier follows are 
The presentation services tier is responsible for: 
• Gathering information from the user 
• Sending the user information to the business services for processing 
• Receiving the results of the business services processing 
• Presenting those results to the user 
The business services tier is responsible for: 
• Receiving input from the presentation tier. 
• Interacting with the data services to perform the business operations. 
• Sending the processed results to the presentation tier. 
The data services tier is responsible for the: 
• Storage of data. 
• Retrieval of data. 
• Maintenance of data. 
• Integrity of data. 
In Windows DNA applications commonly implement their business logic using one or 
more of three implementation options. 
• Asp Pages 
• COM components 
• Stored procedures running in the DBMS 
Writing much business logic in ASP pages is a bad idea. Since simple languages are 
used, such as Microsoft Visual Basic Script, and the code is interpreted each time it is 
executed, which hurts the performance. Code in ASP pages is also hard to maintain, 
largely because business logic is commonly intermixed with presentation code that 
creates the user interface. 
One recommended approach for writing middle-tier business logic is to implement that 
logic as COM objects. This approach is a bit more complex than writing a pure ASP 
application. Wrapping business logic in COM objects also cleanly separates this code 
from the presentation code contained in ASP pages, making the application easier to 
maintain. 
The Third option for writing business logic is to create some of that code as stored 
procedures running in the database management system (DBMS). Although a primary 
reason for using stored procedures is to isolate the details of database schema from 
business logic to simplify code management and security, having code in such a close 
proximity to data can also help optimize performance. 
2.2 Challenges faced by developers 
In Windows DNA, there are two major choices of user interfaces - Win32 clients and 
browser based clients. During the Internet revolution of the late 90s we saw the 
emergence of the browser and the Web Server. With the introduction of Internet, 
information started being available but with limited functionality. With the development 
of the Windows Distributed Internet Architecture, we started to see Web sites that 
allowed simple transactions to occur. Clients on browsers could access Web sites that had 
COM components available to them that allowed them to retrieve information from the 
database. So now we gained the capability to simulate the environment of the Win32 
platform. The client software – the browser – can access information on a server. But as 
with the Win32 environment, we are limited in the way in which the information is 
presented to us. Customization is neither widespread nor broadly developed.  
 Let us look into limitations of these technologies. 
Limitations in Win32 Clients 
In a client-server environment visual tool such as Visual Basic, are often used to create a 
rich user interface. The drawbacks is that such client software is difficult to deploy and 
maintain, requiring and install on every client and a change to every client when an 
upgrade is needed. 
DLL conflicts on the client are frequent because of variations in the version of the 
operating system and other software installed on the client. 
Visual Basic is the most common language used to write middle-tier components. This 
requires high level of expertise in COM. Since these middle-tire components are 
implemented using Microsoft Transaction Server on Windows NT or COM+ services on 
Windows 2000. These components use stateless designs, which can look very different 
from the stateful designs often used in client-based components. 
COM components, in the middle tier must work together, Versioning all the components 
properly so that they understand each other's interfaces can be a challenge. This requires 
a highly sophisticated skill level and a well - controlled deployment process. 
COM works well on Microsoft platforms. But it suffers from lack of interoperability with 
other platforms. One of the most important ways functionality can be reused is for a 
software component to inherit another component, But COM does not support 
inheritance. 
Visual Basic is the most popular language for developing applications with the DNA 
model, this is used in two major roles - forms based VB Clients and COM components. 
This VB6 language has its own limitations it doesn’t have the capability of 
multithreading, lack of OOPS concepts, Poor error handling ability and poor integration 
with other languages. Hence it makes it unsuitable for development of object-based 
frameworks. 
Today’s applications need to use the Win32 API for a variety of purposes like monitor 
widows messages, manipulate controls, reading and writing to INI files and socket 
programming etc. But these widows API are hard to program for variety of reasons, like 
it is not object oriented and complex calls to the functions with long lists of arguments, 
since Win32 API is written in C++ language, getting calling conventions right on data 
types is messy. 
Limitations in DNA-Based Internet Development or Browser based clients 
With DNA - based software development, creating software that is accessed by a 
user locally is done very differently from development for the Internet. The Visual Basic 
forms for client-server user interfaces versus the use of Active Server Pages for Internet 
user interfaces. Even though both situations involve designing and implementing GUI 
based user interfaces the tools and programming techniques used are quite different. 
ASP lacks in state management between post backs. Every time a page is 
rendered, the programmer must make sure that all the visual controls like text boxes, 
dropdowns have their information loaded. It is the programmer's responsibility to manage 
the state in the user interface and to transfer state information between pages. This causes 
developers to have to write a lot of code for the internet user interfaces that is not relevant 
to business problem being solved. 
If the Internet application is going to run on a group of Web Servers, then 
considerable additional work is necessary to design a state management system that is 
independent of particular server. 
Browser based clients are somewhat more difficult to create, and offer a more 
limited user interface with fewer controls and less control over layout of the screen and 
handling of screen events. It is possible to create rich user interfaces using DHTML, but 
it requires lot of coding and also browser compatibility issues rises, for which a separate 
coding or two version of the same page have to be maintained, keeping in mind, the 
browser we are targeting. 
The Internet has caused server-based applications to become much more popular 
than ever before and has made the connectionless request/response programming model 
common. But communicating between servers—especially among those running on 
different platforms—is difficult, and because most substantial Internet applications are 
Database-Centric, the ability to access a wide variety of data sources easily is more 
important than ever. 
As we move on to handheld devices or wireless devices, kiosks or other type of 
systems, many of which run a different processors and do not use standard operating 
system. So sharing the data between these devices and communication varies which is not 
uniform, becomes difficult. 
2.3 NET Philosophy / Where does .NET fit in? 
The driving force behind Microsoft® .NET is a shift in focus from individual Web sites 
or devices to new constellations of computers, devices, and services that work together to 
deliver broader, richer solutions. 
The platform, technology that people use is changing. Since 1992, the client/server 
environment has been in place, with people running the applications they need on the 
Win32 platform, for example. Information is supplied by the databases on the servers, 
and programs that are installed on the client machine determine how that information is 
presented and processed.  
One of the things people are looking for is a one-sentence definition of ".NET". What is 
it? Why should I care? .NET is Microsoft's strategy for software that empowers people 
any time, any place, and on any device.  
Many of the goals Microsoft had in mind when designing .NET reflect the limitations we 
previously discussed for development with previous tools and technologies. 
Microsoft.NET solutions  
• Single Programming Model A related goal is to have development for the internet 
environment look very much like development for other types of software. Likewise, 
developing user interfaces in Windows Forms is very similar to developing them in 
Web Forms. There are commonly used controls, such as Labels and Text Boxes, in 
both, with similar sets of properties and method. The amount of commonality makes 
it easy to transition between the two types of development, and easier for traditional 
VB developers to start using Web Forms. 
• Distributed Systems  The Vision of Microsoft.NET is globally distributed systems, 
using XML as the universal glue to allow functions running on different computers 
across an organization or across the world to come together in a single application. In 
this vision, systems from servers to Wireless Palmtops, with everything in between, 
will share the same general platform, with versions of .NET available for all of them, 
and with each of them able to integrate transparently with the others. 
• Richer User Interface  Web Forms are a giant step towards much richer web-based 
user interfaces. Their built-in intelligence allows rich, browser-independent screens to 
be developed quickly, and to be easily integrated with compiled code. Microsoft has 
announced an initiative for the future called the Universal Canvas which builds upon 
the XML standards to transform the internet from a Read only environment into a 
read/write platform, enabling users to interactively create, browse, edit and analyze 
information. The universal canvas can bring together multiple sources of information 
anywhere in the world to enable seamless data access and use.(The universal canvas 
will log on to the Ms System of servers whenever the new device is turned on) 
Centrally controlled OS, Office and Visual Studio. 
• Easy Deployment  Executable modules in .NET are self-describing. Once the 
Common Language Runtime (CLR is explained in next sections) knows where a 
module resides, it can find out everything else it needs to know to run the module, 
such as the module’s object interface and security requirements, from the module 
itself. That means a module can just be copied to a new environment and immediately 
executed.  
• Support for Multiple Languages  The CLR executes binary code called MSIL 
(Microsoft intermediate language), and that code looks the same regardless of the 
original source language. All .NET –enabled languages use the same data types and 
the same interfacing conventions. This makes possible for all .NET language to 
interoperate transparently. One language can call another easily, and languages can 
even inherit classes written in another language and extend them current platform has 
anywhere near this level of language interoperability. 
• Extendibility The completely object based approach of .NET is designed to allow 
base functionality to be extended through inheritance ( unlike COM) and the 
platform’s functionality is appropriately partitioned to allow various parts( such as the 
just-in-time compilers discussed in the next section) to be replaced as new versions 
are needed. It is likely that, in the future, new ways of interfacing to the outside world 
will be added to the current trio of windows Form, Web Forms, and Web Services 
such as universal Canvas. 
• Portability of compiled Applications   .NET allows the future possibility of moving 
software to other hardware and operating system platforms. The ultimate goal is that 
compiled code produced on one implementation of .NET (such as Windows) could be 
moved to another implementation of .NET on a different operating system merely by 
copying the compiled code over and running it. 
• Integrity with COM  .NET integrates very will with COM-based software. Any COM 
component can be treated as a .NET component by other .NET components. The 
.NET Framework wraps COM components and exposes an interface that .NET 
components can work with. This is absolutely essential to the quick acceptance of 
.NET, because it makes .NET interoperable with a tremendous amount of older 
COM-based software.  
Other benefits of using .NET architecture   
• The Microsoft .NET platform's reliance on XML for data exchange—an open 
standard managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)—and modular XML 
Web services removes barriers to data sharing and software integration. 
• The .NET platform, through the .NET Framework's common language runtime, 
enables XML Web services to interoperate whatever their source language. 
Developers can build reusable XML Web services instead of monolithic applications. 
By making it easy to offer your XML Web services to others. 
• The ability to easily find available XML Web services means you can buy pieces of 
your applications rather than build everything from scratch, focusing your time and 
money where it makes the most sense. 
• Easier to build sophisticated development tools – debuggers and profilers can target 
the Common Language Runtime, and thus become accessible to all .NET-enabled 
languages. 
• Potentially better performance in system level code for memory management, 
garbage collection, and the like have yielded an architecture that should meet or 
exceed performance of typical COM-based applications today. 
• Fewer bugs, as whole classes of bugs should be unknown in .NET. With the CLR 
handling memory management, garbage collection. 
• Faster development using development tool like visual studio.net 
N-tier architecture with .NET 
Applications developed in the .NET Framework will still, in, many cases, use a DNA 
model to design the appropriate tiers. However, the tiers will be a lot easier to produce in 
.NET. The presentation tier will benefit from the new interface technologies and 
especially Web Forms for Internet development. The middle tier will require far less 
COM-related headaches to develop and implement. And richer, more distributed middle 
tier designs will be possible by using Web Services. 
Let us look into how .Net fit into n – tier architecture. When you talk about a true 
distributed n-tier type of application, you are talking about separating the components of 
the different tiers on different machines as well as in separate components. Figure 1 
shows a typical example of an n-tier application with multiple components on each 
machine. 
Figure 1. A distributed n-tier application has three physical tiers with one or more 
logical tiers on each machine 
There are many different ways you could configure an n-tier application. For example, 
the business rules may go on a separate machine and you might use .NET Remoting to 
talk from the client application to the business rule tier as shown in Figure 2. 
We may also have a data input validation rule component on the client to check simple 
rules such as required fields and formatting. These are rules that you do not want to make 
a trip across the network just to check. You may then also add a business rule layer on the 
same tier as the data layer component to check complicated business rules that compare 
the data from one table to another. 
These are just a few different configurations that you may utilize. Of course, you could 
come up with something unique that fits your specific situation. Regardless of how you 
structure the physical implementation of the components, make sure that the logical 
structure of the program is broken up into components as shown in the above figures. 
2.4 Understanding the .NET Platform and its layers 
Here in this section we will be covering what the .NET Platform is made up of 
and we will define its layers. To start, .NET is a framework that covers all the layers 
of software development above the Operating System. It provides the richest level of 
integration among presentation technologies, component technologies, and data 
technologies ever seen on Microsoft, or perhaps any, platform. Secondly, the entire 
architecture has been created to make it easy to develop Internet applications, as it 
is to develop for the desktop. 
Constituents of .NET Platform
The .NET consists of the following three main parts 
• .NET Framework – a completely re-engineered development environment. 
• .NET Products – applications from MS based on the .NET platform, including 
Office and Visual Studio. 
• .NET Services – facilitates 3rd party developers to create services on the .NET 
Platform.

.NET Platform Architecture 
.NET
The above diagram gives you an overview of the .NET architecture. At the bottom of 
the diagram is your Operating System above that sits the .NET framework that acts 
as an interface to it. The .NET wraps the operating system, insulating software 
developed with .NET from most operating system specifics such as file handling and 
memory allocation. 
The Common Language Runtime (CLR)
At the base is the CLR. It is considered as the heart of the .NET framework. .NET 
applications are compiled to a common language known as Microsoft Intermediate 
Language or “IL”. The CLR, then, handles the compiling the IL to machine language, 
at which point the program is executed.  
The CLR environment is also referred to as a managed environment, in which 
common services, such as garbage collection and security, are automatically 
provided. 
More information on CLR is available at  
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconthecommonlanguageruntime.asp
The .NET Class Framework
The next layer up in the framework is called the .NET Class Framework also referred 
as .NET base class library. The .NET Class Framework consists of several thousand 
type definitions, where each type exposes some functionality. All in all, the CLR and 
the .NET Class Framework allow developers to build the following kinds of 
applications: 
• Web Services. Components that can be accessed over the Internet very easily.  
• Web Forms. HTML based applications (Web Sites).  
• Windows Forms. Rich Windows GUI applications. Windows form applications can 
take advantage of controls, mouse and keyboard events and can talk directly to 
the underlying OS.  
• Windows Console Applications. Compilers, utilities and tools are typically 
implemented as console applications. 
• Windows Services. It is possible to build service applications controllable via the 
Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) using the .NET Framework. 
• Component Library. .NET Framework allows you to build stand-alone components 
(types) that may be easily incorporated into any of the above mentioned 
application types.  
ADO.NET: Data and XML  
ADO.NET is the next generation of Microsoft ActiveX Data Object (ADO) technology. 
ADO.NET is heavily dependent on XML for representation of data. It also provides an 
improved support for the disconnected programming model.  
ADO.NET’s DataSet object, is the core component of the disconnected architecture of 
ADO.NET. The DataSet can also be populated with data from an XML source, whether 
it is a file or an XML stream. 
For more details on ADO.NET, check out  
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconaccessingdatawithadonet.asp
User Interface
The next layer consists of the user and programming interface that allows .NET to 
interact with the outside world. The following are the types of interaction interfaces 
that are supported by the .NET framework: 
• Web Forms 
• Windows Forms 
• Web Services 
Now let me tell you about Windows Forms and ASP.NET. WinForms (Windows Forms) 
is simply the name used to describe the creation of a standard Win32 kind of GUI 
applications.  
The Active Server Pages web development framework has undergone extensive 
changes in ASP.NET. The programming language of choice is now full-blown VB.NET 
or C# (or any supported .NET language for that matter). Other changes include: 
• New support for HTML Server Controls (session state supported on the server). 
• It is now possible for the server to process client-side events. 
• New control families including enhanced Intrinsics, Rich controls, List controls, 
DataGrid control, Repeater control, Data list control, and validation controls. 
• New support for developing Web Services—application logic programmatically 
accessible via the Internet that can be integrated into .NET applications using the 
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). 
Languages
The CLR allows objects created in one language be treated as equal citizens by code 
written in a completely different language. To make this possible, Microsoft has 
defined a Common Language Specification (CLS) that details for compiler vendors 
the minimum set of features that their compilers must support if they are to target 
the runtime.  
Any language that conforms to the CLS can run on the CLR. In the .NET framework, 
Microsoft provides Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual C#, and JScript support.  
.NET Products
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET represents the best development environment for the 
.NET platform. 
Integrations is the key in the new VS.NET IDE, thus a single IDE can be used to 
program in a variety of managed languages from VB.NET to Visual C++ with 
Managed extensions. Advance features in VS.NET truly propel development in to the 
highest gear. 
.NET Services:
XML Web Services 
XML is turning the way we build and use software inside out. The Web revolutionized 
how users talk to applications. XML is revolutionizing how applications talk to other 
applications—or more broadly, how computers talk to other computers—by providing 
a universal data format that lets data be easily adapted or transformed: 
• XML Web services allow applications to share data.  
• XML Web services are discrete units of code; each handles a limited set of tasks.  
• They are based on XML, the universal language of Internet data exchange, and 
can be called across platforms and operating systems, regardless of 
programming language.  
• .NET is a set of Microsoft software technologies for connecting your world of 
information, people, systems, and devices through the use of XML Web services.

Common Language Specification (CLI)
    Just-in-Time Compilation 
Common Language Runtime (CLR)
The .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the Common Language 
Runtime, which manages the execution of code and provides services that make the 
development process easier. Compilers and tools expose the runtime's functionality 
and enable you to write code that benefits from this managed execution 
environment. Code developed with a language compiler that targets the runtime is 
called managed code. 
To enable the runtime to provide services to managed code, language compilers 
must emit metadata, which the runtime uses to locate and load classes, lay out 
instances in memory, resolve method invocations, generate native code, enforce 
security, and set run-time context boundaries. 
The runtime automatically handles objects, releasing them when they are no longer 
being used. Objects whose lifetimes are managed in this way are called managed 
data. Automatic memory management eliminates memory leaks as well as many 
other common programming errors. 
The CLR makes it easy to design components and applications whose objects interact 
across languages. For example, you can define a class and then use a different 
language to derive a class from your original class, or call a method on the original 
class. You can also pass an instance of a class to a method on a class written in a 
different language. This cross-language integration is possible because of the 
common type system defined by the runtime, and they follow the runtime's rules for 
defining new types, as well as for creating, using, persisting, and binding to types. 
Language compilers and tools expose the runtime's functionality in ways that are 
intended to be useful and intuitive to their developers. This means that some 
features of the runtime might be more noticeable in one environment than in 
another. How you experience the runtime depends on which language compilers or 
tools you use. The following benefits of the runtime might be particularly interesting 
to you: 
• Performance improvements.  
• The ability to easily use components developed in other languages.  
• Extensible types provided by a class library.  
• A broad set of language features.  
2.5 Understanding the various components of the .NET Platform 
and the functions performed by them 
Now we will go in detail about the various components that build the .NET framework 
and its functionalities.  
Common Language Runtime
At the core of the .NET platform is the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR 
simplifies application development, provides a robust and secure execution 
environment, supports multiple languages and simplifies application deployment and 
management. 
The diagram below provides more details on the CLR's features: 
In this section we will cover some of the more significant features provided to .NET 
applications by the CLR. These include: 
• Memory Management 
• Common Type System 
Before moving further let us discuss briefly about Common Language 
Infrastructure(CLI) according to Standardizing Information and Communication 
Systems(ECMA) specifications. The Microsoft Shared Source CLI Implementation is a 
file archive containing working source code for the ECMA-334 (C#) and ECMA-335 
(Common Language Infrastructure, or CLI) standards. In addition to the CLI 
implementation and the C# compiler, the Shared Source CLI Implementation from 
Microsoft called ROTOR contains tools, utilities, additional Framework classes, and 
samples. 
For the benefit of existing codebases, the CLI standard also takes pains to describe 
in detail how unmanaged software can co-exist safely with managed components, 
enabling seamless sharing of computing resources and responsibilities. 
Like the C runtime, the CLI has been designed to exploit the power of diverse 
platforms, as well as to complement existing tools, languages, and runtimes. Let's 
look at a few of the likely ways that the Shared Source CLI Implementation might 
interest you: 
• There are significant differences in implementation between this code and the 
code for Microsoft's commercial CLR implementation, both to facilitate portability 
and to make the code base more approachable. If you are a developer who is 
interested in knowing how JIT compilers and garbage collectors work, or of how 
Microsoft Visual Studio works on your behalf under the covers, this distribution 
will definitely hold your attention!  
• The distribution will help you in creating courseware around interesting topics 
that can be illustrated by this codebase. 
• The distribution will help you in implementing your own version of the CLI and it 
also helps you in understanding the way the compilers and tools target the CLI. 
Automatic Memory Management
Now let us discuss about an important feature of the CLR called Automatic Memory 
Management. A major feature of .NET framework CLR is that the runtime 
automatically handles the allocation and release of an object’s memory resources. 
Automatic memory management enhances code quality and developer productivity 
without negatively impacting expressiveness or performance. 
The Garbage Collector (GC) is responsible for collecting the objects no longer 
referenced by the application. The GC may automatically be invoked by the CLR or 
the application may explicitly invoke the GC by calling GC.Collect. Objects are not 
released from memory until the GC is invoked and setting an object reference to 
Nothing does not invoke the GC, a period of time often elapses between when the 
object is no longer referenced by the application and when the GC collects it. 
Common Type System
The Common Type System defines how data types are declared, used, and managed 
in the runtime, and is also an important part of the runtime’s support for the Cross
Language Integration. The common type system performs the following functions:  
• Establishes a framework that enables cross-language integration, type safety, 
and high performance code execution.  
• Provides an object-oriented model that supports the complete implementation of 
many programming languages.  
• Defines rules that languages must follow, which helps ensure that objects written 
in different languages can interact with each other.  
The Common Type System can be divided into two general categories of types,  
Reference type and Value type each of which is further divided into subcategories. 
Common Type System Architecture
The .NET type system has two different kinds of types namely Value types and 
Reference types. 
Value types directly contain the data, and instances of value types are either 
allocated on the stack or allocated inline in a structure. Value types can be built-in 
(implemented by the runtime), user-defined, or enumerations.  
The core value types supported by the .NET platform reside within the root of the 
System namespace. There types are often referred to as the .NET “Primitive Types”.  
They include: 
• Boolean 
• Byte 
• Char 
• DateTime 
• Decimal 
• Double 
• Guid 
• Int16 
• Int32 
• Int64 
• SByte 
• Single 
• Timespan 
Reference types store a reference to the value's memory address, and are 
allocated on the heap. Reference types can be self-describing types, pointer types, or 
interface types. The type of a reference type can be determined from values of self
describing types. Self-describing types are further split into arrays and class types. 
Value Type vs. Reference Type
The primary difference between reference and value types is how instances of the 
two types are treated by the CLR. One difference is that the GC collects instances of 
reference types that are no longer referenced by the application. Instances of value 
types are automatically cleaned up when the variable goes out of scope. Let’s take a 
look at an example in VB.NET: 
Sub Test() 
Dim myInteger as Integer 
Dim myObject as Object 
End Sub 
‘myInteger a Value type is automatically cleaned up when the Sub ends. 
‘But myObject a Reference type is not cleaned up until the GC is run. 
Another difference is when one variable is set equal to another or passed as a 
parameter to a method call. When a variable of a reference type (A) is set equal to 
another variable of the same type (B), variable A is assigned a reference to B. Both 
variables reference the same object. When a variable of value type (A) is set equal 
to another variable of the same type (B), variable A receives a copy of the contents 
of B. Each variable will have its own individual copy of the data. 
Yet another difference between the behaviors of value types versus reference types 
is how equality is determined. Two variables of a given reference type are 
determined to be equal if both the variables refer to the same object. Two variables 
of a given value type are determined to be equal if the state of the two variables are 
equal. 
The final difference between the two is the way the instances of a type are initialized. 
In a reference type, the variable is initialized with a default value of Null. The 
variable will not reference an object until explicitly done by the object. Whereas a 
variable declared as a value type will always reference a valid object. 
Custom Types
A Custom Type is a set of data and related behavior that is defined by the developer. 
A developer can define both custom reference type and custom value types. 
In vb.net we can define custom types by using the Structure keyword. Let’s look at 
an example wherein we define a custom value type. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We declare a structure by name Test, it signals vb.net compiler to have Test 
derive from System.ValueType and therefore a value type. In the Main() we initialize  
 
 
x and then set y equal to x. Since x and y are both instances of value types, y is set 
equal to the value of x. After changing the fields in y write the value of the fields in 
both x and y to the Console. The output of the program is: 
 
 x: myInt = 4 and myString = Test 
 y: myInt = 1 and myString = Changed 
 
Notice that even after changing the value of fields in y it did not affect x. This is 
exactly the behavior required for primitive types. 
 
Boxing and Unboxing Value Types 
 
Sometimes it is required to treat an instance of a value type as if it were an instance 
of a reference type. An example of this is when a value type is passed ByRef as a 
parameter of a method. This is where the concept of Boxing becomes important. 
 
Boxing occurs when an instance of a value type is converted to a reference type. An 
instance of a value type can be converted either to a System.Object or to any other 
interface type implemented by the value type. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Module Module1  
 Public Structure Test 
  Public myString as String 
  Public myInteger as Integer 
 End Structure 
 
 Public Sub Main() 
  ‘Notice that both declarations are equivalent 
  ‘Both x and y are instance of type test 
 
  Dim x as New Test() 
  Dim y as Test 
   
  x.myInteger = 4 
  y.myString = “Test” 
 
  ‘Reference to x is assigned to y 
  y = x 
 
 y.myInteger = 1 
  y.myString = “Changed” 
  
  Console.WriteKine(String.Format(“x :  myInt = {0}  and  String = {1} ”,  _ 
x.myInteger, x.myString)) 
 
Console.WriteKine(String.Format(“y :  myInt = {0}  and  String = {1} ”,  _ 
y.myInteger, y.myString))   
 End Sub 
Module Module1 
 
 Public Function Add(ByVal x As Object, ByVal y As Object) As Object 
  Add = x + y 
 End Function 
 
 Public Sub Main 
  Dim x As Integer = 2 
  Dim y As Integer = 3 
  Dim sum As Integer 
 
  Sum = Add(x , y) 
   
  Console.WriteLine(“ {0) + {1} = {2} ”, x, y, sum) 
   
 End Sub 
 
End Module 
In the above example both x and y are boxed before they are passed to Add.  
Then x,y and Sum are boxed before they are passed to WriteLine. 
Unboxing involves the conversion of an instance of a reference type back to its 
original value type. In Vb.net it is done using the helper functions in the 
Microsoft.VisualBasic.Helpers namespace. For example in the above example, 
IntegerType.FromObject is called to unbox the return parameter of type object back 
to Integer.

The .NET Class Framework
We will now discuss about the .NET Class Framework. In conjunction with the CLR, 
the Microsoft has developed a comprehensive set of framework classes, several of 
which are shown below: 
Since the .NET Class Framework contains literally thousands of types, a set of related 
types is presented to the developer within a single namespace. For example, the 
System namespace (which you should be most familiar with) contains the Object 
base type, from which all other types ultimately derive. In addition the System 
namespace contains types of integers, characters, strings, exception handling, and 
console I/O’s as well as a bunch of utility types that convert safely between data 
types, format data types, generate random numbers, and perform various math 
functions. All applications use types from System namespace. 
To access any platform feature, you need to know which namespace contains the 
type that exposes the functionality you want. If you want to customize the behavior 
of any type, you can simply derive your own type from the desired .NET framework 
type. The .NET Framework relies on the object-oriented nature of the platform to 
present a consistent programming paradigm to software developers. It also enables 
you to create your own namespaces containing their own types, which merge 
seamlessly into the programming paradigm. This greatly simplifies the Software 
Development. 
The table below lists some of the general namespaces, with a brief description of 
what the classes in that namespace is used for: 
 
Namespace Purpose of Class 
System All the basic types used by every application. 
System.Collections Managing collections of objects. Includes the 
popular collection types such as Stacks, Queues, 
HashTables etc. 
System.Diagnostics Instrumenting and Debugging your application. 
System.Drawing Manipulating 2D graphics. Typically used for 
Windows Forms applications and for creating 
Images that are to appear in a web form. 
System.EnterpriseServices Managing Transactions, queued components, 
object pooling, just-in-time activation, security 
and other features to make use of managed code 
more efficient on the server. 
System.Globalization National Language Support(NLS), such as string 
compares, formatting and calendars. 
System.IO Doing Stream I/O, walking directories and files. 
System.Management Managing other computers in the enterprise via 
WMI. 
System.Net Network Communications. 
System.Reflection Inspecting metadata and late binding of types and 
their members. 
System.Resources Manipulating external data resources. 
System.Runtime.InteropServices Enabling managed code to access unmanaged OS 
platform facilities, such as COM components and 
functions in Win32 DLLs. 
System.Runtime.Remoting Accessing types remotely. 
System.Runtime.Serilization Enabling instances of objects to be persisted and 
regenerated from a stream.  
System.Security Protecting data and resources. 
System.Text Working with Text in different encodings, like 
ASCII  or Unicode. 
System.Threading Performing asynchronous operations and 
synchronizing access to resources. 
System.Xml Processing XML Schemas and data. 
 
In addition to the general namespace the .Net Class Framework offers namespaces 
whose types are used for building specific application types. The table below lists 
some of the application specific namespaces: 
 
Namespace Purpose of Types 
System.Web.Services Building web services 
System.Web.UI Building web forms. 
System.Windows.Forms Building Windows GUI applications. 
System.ServiceProcess Building a windows service controllable by Service 
Control Manager.

Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT) 
 
The MSIL is the language that all of the .NET languages compile down to. After they 
are in this intermediate language, a process called Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation 
occurs when resources are used from your application at runtime. JIT allows “parts” 
of your application to execute when they are needed, which means that if something 
is never needed, it will never compile down to the native code. By using the JIT, the 
CLR can cache code that is used more than once and reuse it for subsequent calls, 
without going through the compilation process again. 
 
The figure below shows the JIT Process: 
 
  .NET Assembly   Class Loader   
 
Intial Reference  
        to type   
 
 Assembly Resolver    IL to PE Conversion 
 
 
 
       Managed code        Initial Method  
              Call   
 
 
        CPU  
JIT Compilation Process 
 
The JIT process enables a secure environment by making certain assumptions: 
 
• Type references are compatible with the type being referenced. 
• Operations are invoked on an object only if they are within the execution 
parameters for that object. 
• Identities within the application are accurate. 
 
By following these rules, the managed execution can guarantee that code being 
executed is type safe; the execution will only take place in memory that it is allowed 
to access. This is possible by the verification process that occurs when the MSIL is 
converted into CPU-specific code. During this verification, the code is examined to 
ensure that it is not corrupt, it is type safe, and the code does not interfere with 
existing security policies that are in place on the system. 
 
 
 
2.6 Structure of a .NET Application 
 
DLL Hell 
 
DLLs gave developers the ability to create function libraries and programs that could 
be shared with more than one application. Windows itself was based on DLLs. While 
the advantages of shared code modules expanded developer opportunities, it also 
introduced the problem of updates, revisions, and usage. If one program relied on a 
specific version of a DLL, and another program upgraded that same DLL, the first 
program quite often stopped working.  
Microsoft added to the problem with upgrades of some system DLLs, like comctl.dll, 
the library used to get file, font, color and printing dialog boxes. If things weren't 
bad enough with version clashes, if you wanted to uninstall an application, you could 
easily delete a DLL that was still being used by another program.  
Recognizing the problem, Microsoft incorporated the ability to track usage of DLLs 
with the Registry starting formally with Windows 95, and allowed only one version of 
a DLL to run in memory at a time. Adding yet another complication, when a new 
application was installed that used an existing DLL, it would increment a usage 
counter. On uninstall, the counter would be decremented and if no application was 
using the DLL, it could be deleted.  
That was, in theory. Over the history of Windows, the method of tracking of DLL 
usage was changed by Microsoft several times, as well as the problem of rogue 
installations that didn't play by the rules--the result was called "DLL HELL", and the 
user was the victim.  
Solving DLL hell is one thing that the .NET Framework and the CLR targeted. Under 
the .NET Framework, you can now have multiple versions of a DLL running 
concurrently. This allows developers to ship a version that works with their program 
and not worry about stepping on another program. The way .NET does this is to 
discontinue using the registry to tie DLLs to applications and by introducing the 
concept of an assembly.  
On the .NET Platform, if you want to install an application in the clients place all you 
have to do is use XCopy which copies all the necessary program files to a directory 
on the client’s computer. And while uninstalling all you have to do is just delete the 
directory containing the application and your application is uninstalled. 
Metadata
An Assembly is a logical DLL and consists of one or more scripts, DLLs, or 
executables, and a manifest (a collection of metadata in XML format describing how 
assembly elements relate). Metadata stored within the Assembly, is Microsoft's 
solution to the registry problem. On the .NET Platform programs are compiled into 
.NET PE (Portable Executable) files. The header section of every .NET PE file contains 
a special new section for Metadata (This means Metadata for every PE files is 
contained within the PE file itself thus abolishing the need for any separate registry 
entries). Metadata is nothing but a description of every namespace, class, method, 
property etc. contained within the PE file. Through Metadata you can discover all the 
classes and their members contained within the PE file.  
Metadata describes every type and member defined in your code in a Multilanguage 
form. Metadata stores the following information: 
• Description of the assembly  
o 
Identity (name, version, culture, public key).  
o 
o 
The types that are exported.  
Other assemblies that this assembly depends on.  
o 
Security permissions needed to run 
• Description of types  
o 
Name, visibility, base class, and interfaces implemented.  
o 
Members (methods, fields, properties, events, nested types) 
• Attributes  
o 
Additional descriptive elements that modify types and members 
Advantages of Metadata:
Now let us see the advantages of Metadata: 
Self describing files: 
CLR modules and assemblies are self-describing. Module's metadata contains 
everything needed to interact with another module. Metadata automatically provides 
the functionality of Interface Definition Language (IDL) in COM, allowing you to use 
one file for both definition and implementation. Runtime modules and assemblies do 
not even require registration with the operating system. As a result, the descriptions 
used by the runtime always reflect the actual code in your compiled file, which 
increases application reliability.  
Language Interoperability and easier component-based design: 
Metadata provides all the information required about compiled code for you to inherit 
a class from a PE file written in a different language. You can create an instance of 
any class written in any managed language (any language that targets the Common 
Language Runtime) without worrying about explicit marshaling or using custom 
interoperability code.  
Attributes: 
The .NET Framework allows you to declare specific kinds of metadata, called 
attributes, in your compiled file. Attributes can be found throughout the .NET 
Framework and are used to control in more detail how your program behaves at run 
time. Additionally, you can emit your own custom metadata into .NET Framework 
files through user-defined custom attributes.  
Assembly
Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET Framework applications; they form the 
fundamental unit of deployment, version control, reuse, activation scoping, and 
security permissions. An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are 
built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. An assembly provides 
the common language runtime with the information it needs to be aware of type 
implementations. To the runtime, a type does not exist outside the context of an 
assembly. 
An assembly does the following functions: 
• It contains the code that the runtime executes.  
• It forms a security boundary. An assembly is the unit at which permissions are 
requested and granted. 
• It forms a type boundary. Every type’s identity includes the name of the 
assembly at which it resides. 
• It forms a reference scope boundary. The assembly's manifest contains assembly 
metadata that is used for resolving types and satisfying resource requests. It 
specifies the types and resources that are exposed outside the assembly.  
• It forms a version boundary. The assembly is the smallest version able unit in the 
common language runtime; all types and resources in the same assembly are 
versioned as a unit.  
• It forms a deployment unit. When an application starts, only the assemblies the 
application initially calls must be present. Other assemblies, such as localization 
resources or assemblies containing utility classes, can be retrieved on demand. 
This allows applications to be kept simple and thin when first downloaded. 
• It is a unit where side-by-side execution is supported. 
Contents of an Assembly
• Assembly Manifest 
• Assembly Name 
• Version Information 
• Types 
• Locale 
• Cryptographic Hash 
• Security Permissions 
Assembly Manifest
Every assembly, whether static or dynamic, contains a collection of data that 
describes how the elements in the assembly relate to each other. The assembly 
manifest contains this assembly metadata. An assembly manifest contains the 
following details: 
• Identity. An assembly's identity consists of three parts: a name, a version 
number, and an optional culture. 
• File list. A manifest includes a list of all files that make up the assembly.  
• Referenced assemblies. Dependencies between assemblies are stored in the 
calling assembly's manifest. The dependency information includes a version 
number, which is used at run time to ensure that the correct version of the 
dependency is loaded. 
• Exported types and resources. The visibility options available to types and 
resources include "visible only within my assembly" and "visible to callers outside 
my assembly." 
• Permission requests. The permission requests for an assembly are grouped into 
three sets: 1) those required for the assembly to run, 2) those that are desired 
but the assembly will still have some functionality even if they aren't granted, 
and 3) those that the author never wants the assembly to be granted. 
In general, if you have an application comprising of an assembly named Assem.exe 
and a module named Mod.dll. Then the assembly manifest stored within the PE 
Assem.exe will not only contain metadata about the classes, methods etc. contained 
within the Assem.exe file but it will also contain references to the classes, methods 
etc, exported in the Mod.dll file. While the module Mod.dll will only contain metadata 
describing itself. 
The following diagram shows the different ways the manifest can be stored: 
For an assembly with one associated file, the manifest is incorporated into the PE file 
to form a single-file assembly. You can create a multifile assembly with a standalone 
manifest file or with the manifest incorporated into one of the PE files in the 
assembly. 
The Assembly Manifest performs the following functions: 
• Enumerates the files that make up the assembly.  
• Governs how references to the assembly's types and resources map to the files 
that contain their declarations and implementations.  
• Enumerates other assemblies on which the assembly depends.  
• Provides a level of indirection between consumers of the assembly and the 
assembly's implementation details.  
• Renders the assembly self-describing.  
For more information on Assemblies refer: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconassemblies.asp
Modules
Modules are also PE files (always with the extension .netmodule) which contain 
Metadata but they do not contain the assembly manifest. And hence in order to use a 
module, you have to create a PE file with the necessary assembly manifest. 
In C#, you can create a module using the /t:module compiler switch. 
There are a few ways to incorporate a module into an Assembly. You can either use 
/addmodule switch to add module/s to your assembly, or you can directly use the 
/t:exe, /t:winexe and /t:library switches to convert the module into an assembly. 
Difference between Module and Assembly
A module is an .exe or .dll file. An assembly is a set of one or more modules that 
together make up an application. If the application is fully contained in an .exe file, 
fine—that's a one-module assembly. If the .exe is always deployed with two .dll files 
and one thinks of all three files as comprising an inseparable unit, then the three 
modules together form an assembly, but none of them does so by itself. If the 
product is a class library that exists in a .dll file, then that single .dll file is an 
assembly. To put it in Microsoft's terms, the assembly is the unit of deployment in 
.NET.  
An assembly is more than just an abstract way to think about sets of modules. When 
an assembly is deployed, one (and only one) of the modules in the assembly must 
contain the assembly manifest, which contains information about the assembly as a 
whole, including the list of modules contained in the assembly, the version of the 
assembly, its culture, etc.  
Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL)
When compiling to managed code, the compiler translates your source code into 
Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL), which is a CPU-independent set of 
instructions that can be efficiently converted to native code. MSIL includes 
instructions for loading, storing, initializing, and calling methods on objects, as well 
as instructions for arithmetic and logical operations, control flow, direct memory 
access, exception handling, and other operations. Before code can be executed, MSIL 
must be converted to CPU-specific code by a just in time (JIT) compiler. Because the 
runtime supplies one or more JIT compilers, for each computer architecture it 
supports, the same set of MSIL can be JIT-compiled and executed on any supported 
architecture. 
When a compiler produces MSIL, it also produces metadata. The MSIL and metadata 
are contained in a portable executable (PE file) that is based on and extends the 
published Microsoft PE and Common Object File Format (COFF) used historically for 
executable content. This file format, which accommodates MSIL or native code as 
well as metadata, enables the operating system to recognize common language 
runtime images. The presence of metadata in the file along with the MSIL enables 
your code to describe itself, which means that there is no need for type libraries or 
Interface Definition Language (IDL). The runtime locates and extracts the metadata 
from the file as needed during execution.

3.1 Introduction 
We all know that there have been disparities between different languages such as VB, 
VC++ and developers, who code program through these languages. The disparity lies in 
terms of language features, performance, and flexibility in developing any piece of 
program. Well it’s a known fact that, at the end, what matters is how efficiently your 
programs run on the client machine, no matter what language you use. Earlier this was 
driven by compilers, which were used to compile the code written using these languages 
to make it native code (processor specific).  
With the release .NET framework Microsoft has driven out the disparities in such a way 
that no matter whatever .NET language you use to develop .NET applications, still the 
end result will be determined by .NET framework runtime and not by the language 
compilers as it was happening earlier. In this tutorial we will identify some of the key 
elements of the .NET framework through a simple program and concentrate on how  
.NET framework Runtime addresses platform or processor specific code issues to 
produce optimized code, which is native to the processor and to know how the 
framework helps in managing code effectively. 
Common Language Runtime (CLR) 
The primary function of a runtime is to support and manage the execution of code 
targeted for a language or a platform. For example, the Microsoft VC++ requires the 
msvcrt60.dll that contains its core support functionality. Even languages like Java have a 
run time, in the form of Java Virtual Machine. 
The .Net platform also comes with a runtime that is officially called as the Common 
Language Runtime or simply the CLR. The CLR is designed to support a variety of 
different types of applications, from Web server applications to applications with 
traditional rich Windows user interface. Though the role of the CLR is similar to its 
counterparts in other languages or platforms, there are some key differences that make it 
one of the major features of the .NET platform. Here are the key differences between the 
.NET CLR and runtime of other languages: 
• It is a common runtime for all languages targeting the .NET platform. 
• It acts as an agent that manages code at execution time and also provides core 
services such as memory management, thread management and remoting.  
• It enforces strict type safety and other forms of code accuracy that ensure security and 
robustness.  
• It is responsible for enabling and facilitating the Common Type System. The 
Common Type System allows classes that are written in any .NET language to 
interoperate with—even inherit from, with overrides—classes written in any 
language. So your COBOL.NET program can interoperate with your C#, VB.NET, 
Eiffel.NET and with any other .NET language programs. 
• It offers a mechanism for cross-language exception handling. 
• It provides a more elegant way for resolving the versioning issues (also referred to as 
the Dll Hell in our classic COM). 
• It provides a simplified model for component interaction. 
Code that targets the runtime is known as managed code, while code that does not target 
the runtime is known as unmanaged code. Managed code requires a runtime host to start 
it. The responsibility of the runtime host is to load the runtime into a process, create the 
application domains (we’ll look at this in detail later) within the process, and loads the 
user code into the application domains. While we can write our own runtime hosts using 
the set of APIs provided by Microsoft, the .NET platform by default ships with runtime 
hosts that include the following. 
ASP.NET – Loads the runtime into the process that is to handle the Web request. 
ASP.NET also creates an application domain for each Web application that will run on a 
Web server.  
Microsoft Internet Explorer – Creates application domains in which to run managed 
controls. The .NET Framework supports the download and execution of browser-based 
controls. The runtime interfaces with the extensibility mechanism of Microsoft Internet 
Explorer through a mime filter to create application domains in which to run the managed 
controls. By default, one application domain is created for each Web site.  
Shell executables – Invokes runtime hosting code to transfer control to the runtime each 
time an executable is launched from the shell.  
Now that you have understood conceptually the key features of the CLR in .NET 
framework, you can begin to look into the physical implementation and execution of code 
in the CLR. 
The following figure illustrates the flow of activities from the source code to its 
execution. 
3.2 First VB.NET / C# program 
To start of with any language it’s always worth writing a simple program, which actually 
does nothing but displays a “HelloWorld” string in the screen. Taking this simple 
program we will try to figure out how .NET framework delivers a successful 
HelloWorld.exe. Well to write such a complex program we will go for our favorite editor, 
the choice is unanimous, it’s “Notepad”.  
First VB.NET Program
Figure showing HelloWorld program written using VB.NET 
'This is the famous HelloWorld Program written using VB.NET 
Namespace HelloWorldSample 
'Definition of the Class 
Public Class HelloWorld 
'entry point method for the Class 
Public Shared Sub Main() 
            System.Console.WriteLine("HelloWorld") 
End Sub 
'end of Class Declaration 
End Class 
'end of the Class Module  
'end of namespace 
End Namespace 
This is how it goes in your favorite editor ‘Notepad’
Now let us spend sometime in examining the HelloWorld program to find out what’s new 
in writing code through any .NET language. 
The lines in the program that starts with a ‘(single quote) are comment entries like in 
other programming languages which are excluded in the compilation process. Like VB 
the way in which comment entries are represented remains the same in VB.NET.  
Namespace HelloWorldSample - The keyword “Namespace” is new to some 
programmers who are not familiar with C++.  
‘Namespace’ – a keyword in .NET is used to avoid name collisions i.e. For example, you 
develop a library which has a class named “File” and you use some other library which 
also has a class named “File”, in those cases there are chances of name collision. To 
avoid this you can give a namespace name for your class, which should be meaningful. It 
is always better to follow the syntax (MS Recommended) given below while giving 
names for your namespaces 
CompanyName.TechnologyName 
However the hierarchy can be extended based on the implementation of the classes in the 
library. 
Public Class HelloWorld - This is the class declaration in VB.NET; the interesting thing 
for VB developers is that VB.NET is a fully object-oriented language (so everything is a 
Class here) . The class always ends with an “End Class”.  
‘Public’ - is the modifier to determine the scope of the class (for other modifiers refer 
.NET framework SDK documentation or later parts of this tutorial). HelloWorld is the 
class name given for the class. Consumers of the class will be accessing through this 
name only 
Public Shared Sub Main () - This is called as the entry point function because the 
runtime after loading your applications searches for an entry point from which the actual 
execution starts. C/C++ programmers will find this method very familiar (VB 
Programmers remember Sub Main). All Applications (exe) must have a definition for the 
Main Method. Try removing the Main method from your application and the compiler 
will complain that "No Start Point Defined". This means that the Main Method is the 
starting point of any application, in other words When you execute your Application 
"Main" method is called first automatically. 
'Public' - This is the Access modifier for the Method. Since the Main method should be 
accessible to everyone in order for the .NET Runtime to be able to call it automatically it 
is always defined as public. 
'Shared' - indicates that the method is a Class Method. Hence it can be called without 
making an instance of the class first.  
Now its time to compile and execute this complex program. To compile the above piece 
of code you can use VB.NET compiler. To run the VB.NET compiler make sure you set 
your path variable to point to the place where your VB.NET compiler is available.  (To 
set a new value in the path variable, go to control panel and double click System icon, 
then choose advanced tab and click Environment Variables button to add or edit the 
environmental variables)  
Figure shows compilation of the HelloWorld program for VB.NET 
The compiler used here is “vbc”, which is a visual basic .net compiler accepts the source 
file “HelloWorld.vb” compiles the same to produce a program that’s not true executable, 
instead it generates something called assembly. Here the VB.NET compiler produces a 
Managed Code/Intermediate Language (MSIL) format that uses instructions which are 
CPU-independent. 
 
First C#.NET Program 
 
/* This is the famous helloworld program written using C#.NET */ 
 
/* Indicates that the code is referring System Namespace to access the 
functionality’s of System.dll */ 
 
using System; 
 
// Namespace name given for the class  
namespace HelloWorldSample 
{ 
 //Definition of the class 
 public class HelloWorld 
 { 
  // Entry point method for the class 
  public static void Main() 
  { 
   //Displaying helloworld in the screen 
   System.Console.WriteLine("HelloWorld"); 
  } 
  //end of the class declaration 
 } 
  
 //end of the namespace 
} 
 
Figure showing HelloWorld program written using C#.NET in Notepad 
 
The lines in the program that starts with a // and /*….*/ (comment blocks) are comment 
entries like in other programming languages which are excluded in the compilation 
process. For C or C++ programmers the C# style of coding sounds great because it 
almost follows the same style.    
namespace HelloWorldSample - The keyword “namespace” is new to some 
programmers who are not familiar with C++.  
‘namespace’ – a keyword in .NET is used to avoid name collisions i.e. For example, you 
develop a library which has a class named “File” and you use some other library which 
also has a class named “File”, in those cases there are chances of name collision. To 
avoid this you can give a namespace name for your class, which should be meaningful. It 
is always better to follow the syntax (MS Recommended) given below while giving 
names for your namespaces 
CompanyName.TechnologyName 
However the hierarchy can be extended based on the implementation of the classes in the 
library. 
public class HelloWorld - This is the class declaration in C#.NET; the interesting thing 
for C++ or Java developers is that they can apply the OOPS concepts that are supported 
by C#.NET . The class always ends with an “End Class”.   
‘public’ - is the modifier to determine the scope of the class (for other modifiers refer 
.NET framework SDK documentation or later parts of this tutorial). HelloWorld is the 
class name given for the class. Consumers of the class will be accessing through this 
name only. 
public static void Main () - This is called as the entry point function because the runtime 
after loading your applications searches for an entry point from which the actual 
execution starts. C/C++ programmers will find this method very familiar (VB 
Programmers remember Sub Main). All Applications (exe) must have a definition for the 
Main Method. Try removing the Main method from your application and the compiler 
will complain that "No Start Point Defined". This means that the Main Method is the 
starting point of any application, in other words When you execute your Application 
"Main" method is called first automatically. 
'public' - This is the Access modifier for the Method. Since the Main method should be 
accessible to everyone in order for the .NET Runtime to be able to call it automatically it 
is always defined as public. 
'static' - indicates that the method is a Class Method. Hence it can be called without 
making an instance of the class first.  
‘void’ – indicates the return type of the Main function, here in this case the Main function 
returns nothing so it is mentioned as void, for functions that returns value should have 
appropriate type such as long, string etc., 
Now its time to compile and execute this complex program. To compile the above piece 
of code you can use C# compiler. To run the C# compiler make sure you set your path 
variable to point to the place where your C# compiler is available.  (To set a new value in 
the path variable, go to control panel and double click System icon, then choose 
advanced tab and click Environment Variables button to add or edit the environmental 
variables)  
Figure shows compilation of the HelloWorld program using C# compiler 
The compiler used here is “csc”, which is a visual basic .net compiler accepts the source 
file “HelloWorld.cs” compiles the same to produce a program that’s not true executable, 
instead it generates something called assembly.  
Assembly 
An assembly is a grouping of files deployed as a single file. An assembly almost always 
consists of at least two files: the executable and the manifest. The manifest is a list of all 
the files that exist inside the assembly. The executable content inside the assembly is 
referred to individually as a module. Conceptually, modules correspond to DLLs or 
EXEs; each module contains metadata, in addition to the metadata of its parent assembly. 
The assembly format is an enhanced version of the current Portable Executable (PE) 
format (your normal Windows .EXE file format).  
Manifest 
Manifest is considered as the integral part of every assembly that renders the assembly 
self-describing. The assembly manifest contains the assembly's metadata and it also 
establishes the assembly identity, specifies the files that make up the assembly 
implementation, specifies the types and resources that make up the assembly, itemizes the 
compile-time dependencies on other assemblies, and specifies the set of permissions 
required for the assembly to run properly.  
Metadata 
The standard PE header comes at the beginning of the file. Inside the file is the CLR 
header, followed by the data required to load the code into its process space—referred to 
as metadata. It describes to the execution engine how the module should be loaded, what 
additional files it needs, how to load those additional files, and how to interact with COM 
and the .NET runtime.  
Metadata also describes the methods, interfaces, and classes contained in the module or 
assembly. The information the metadata provides allows the JIT compiler to compile and 
run the module. The metadata section exposes much of your application's internals and 
eases the transition from disassembled IL to useful code. 
3.3 JIT (Just–in-Time Compiler) & Debugging  
The .NET Runtime ships with a Just-In-Time (JIT or JITter) compiler, which will convert 
the MSIL code in to the native code (CPU Specific executable code). So whatever code 
we write will be complied in to MSIL format and the JIT takes over when you run it.  
The .NET runtime/Common Language Runtime (CLR) ships three different classes of 
JITters. The Main JIT compiler converts the MSIL code it to native code with out any 
optimizations. The JIT compiler takes the MSIL code and optimizes it. So this compiler 
requires lot of resources like, time to compile, larger memory footprint, etc. The PreJIT 
is based on the Main JIT and it works like the traditional compilers (compiles MSIL to 
native code during compilation time rather than runtime). This compiler is usually used at 
the time of installation. 
No matter whatever language we used to develop the HelloWorld program, it’s a known 
fact that compiler’s are going to generate a MSIL format, once our code has been 
converted in to MSIL format, from MSIL format all the code that we write will be 
converted to native code in the same way whether if it is a VB.NET source or C# source. 
Intermediate Language (IL) 
To support our discussion let us examine the IL code of HelloWorld program written 
using VB.NET and C#. To visualize the IL code Microsoft provides a disassembler tool 
through which you can easily see the IL code 
To use the tool, choose command prompt and type ILDASM->ILDASM dialog is shown
> choose file open dialog and select the assembly 
(make sure you set your path variable to point to the place where your ILDASM is 
available) 
Figure showing disassembled HelloWorld program 
The above window showing a tree displays the path of the assembly as the root node, 
manifest information and namespace information as the child node (if you do not specify 
the namespace for the class then class name will be shown instead of namespace). 
Figure showing manifest information of helloworld program  
The manifest information shows the dependent assemblies like mscorlib, 
Microsoft.VisualBasic and their versions and it self describes the HelloWorld assembly.  
Since we have a simple program, which does not contain any embedded resource, the 
manifest does not include any information on those. 
Figure showing list of information present in the namespace 
The above figure shows the list of information present within the namespace. In general 
the namespace contains the list of classes, structures, delegates, enums etc., In this case it 
shows the HelloWorld class which in turn contains the methods present in the class. It 
also shows the following information. 
.class public auto ansi 
The above figure shows that HelloWorld is derived from System.Object, System.Object 
is the base class in the .NET framework 
.ctor : void() 
The above figure shows the IL code of the constructor of HelloWorld Class, you can see 
that it in turn calls System.Object::.ctor(), which is the base class’s constructor 
Main : void() 
The above figure shows the IL code of the Main function, which is the entry point for that 
assembly. It also shows the method “System.Console::WriteLine”  is called with the 
string “HelloWorld “ within the Main function  
Compiler Options 
If you can recollect the statement we have used to compile the HelloWorld program is 
vbc HelloWorld.vb for Vb.NET and csc HelloWorld.cs for C# , in this we have used the 
default settings of the compiler. Let us spend sometime in compiling the same code with 
some important options of the vbc /csc compiler. 
In our program we have referred System.Dll assembly, in real life we would be 
application-referring lot of assemblies, in those cases the compiler should be intimated 
about the references. We can achieve this by the option mentioned below 
/reference:<file-list> - needs to be used to indicate the list of references used by the 
application, in short it can also be represented as “/r”.  In our case it will be represented 
like this statement given below 
vbc  /reference:”System.dll”  HelloWorld.vb  for Vb.NET 
csc  /reference:”System.dll”  HelloWorld.cs  for C#.NET 
The compiler by default will produce a HelloWorld.exe, in case you want to create a 
module or a library, then you have to specify the target in the compiler. It can be done 
like this 
vbc /target:library /reference:”System.dll” HelloWorld.vb => to generate a library 
csc /target:library /reference:”System.dll” HelloWorld.cs => to generate a library 
Executing the above line of statement in the command prompt will generate a 
HelloWorld.dll, in the same manner a module can be generated by applying this 
switch  /target:module 
In case if we would like to give a different name to the assembly file then the statement 
given below can be applied 
vbc /target:exe /out:”SampleHelloWorld.exe”
  /reference:”System.dll” 
HelloWorld.vb  
csc
 /target:exe
 /out:”SampleHelloWorld.exe”
  /reference:”System.dll” 
HelloWorld.cs  
In the above statement the switch /out:<filename>  is used to give a different name to the 
output assembly file. 
The above compiler statements what we have seen is for simple applications, let us 
assume we have an application which is a Win32 executable and it has got resources, 
which could be embedded or linked (More on resource file later). An embedded resource 
could be an image for the splash screen, in those cases the following compiler options 
will be used 
/target:winexe  - used to create a Win32 executable file 
/linkresource:<resource file(s)> - used to link a resource file to the assembly 
/resource:<resource file(s)> - used to embed a resource file to the assembly 
/imports:<import list> - used to include the list of namespaces used by the assembly 
For other compiler options refer .Net framework SDK documentation.  
.NET Debugging  
Debugging is the most important feature of any programming language and Visual Studio 
.NET IDE provides this feature in an effective manner (but you can still do pretty good 
job with the .NET SDK alone). Application source code goes through two distinct steps 
before a user can run it. First, the source code is compiled to Microsoft Intermediate 
Language (MSIL) code using a .NET compiler. Then, at runtime, the MSIL code is 
compiled to native code. When we debug a .NET application, this process works in 
reverse. The debugger first maps the native code to the MSIL code. The MSIL code is 
then mapped back to the source code using the programmer's database (PDB) file. In 
order to debug an application, these two mappings must be available to the .NET runtime 
environment. 
To accomplish the mapping between the source code and the MSIL, use 
the/debug:pdbonly compiler switch to create the PDB file (Note: When building 
ASP.NET applications, specify the compilation setting debug="true" in the application’s 
Web.config file). The second mapping between the MSIL code and native code is 
accomplished by setting the JITTracking attribute in our assembly. By specifying the 
/debug compiler switch, the PDB file is created and the JITTracking attribute is enabled. 
When using this compiler switch, a debugger can be attached to an application loaded 
outside of the debugger. 
Once the required mappings exist, there are several means by which to debug our 
applications. We can use the integrated debugger within Visual Studio .NET, or, if we 
prefer, we can use DbgClr, a GUI-based debugger. There is also a command line 
debugger, CorDBG that is included in the .NET Framework SDK.  
 3.4 Managed Vs. Unmanaged Methods/Transitions 
In .Net Framework CLR provides execution of instruction targeted for CLR and the 
instructions that are not targeted for CLR. The instructions targeted for CLR are called as 
managed code and other type of code is called unmanaged code. After going through this 
topic you will know the following things mentioned below  
Difference between Managed Method and Unmanaged Method. 
Difference between Managed Type and Unmanaged Type. 
How to call unmanaged methods in managed methods. 
How to use unmanaged types. 
When an application is launched for execution, first request is given to the Operating 
System, the OS will load the executable file in memory and starts executing the 
instruction from the entry point function in the executable file. Where in .NET executable 
file contains four main components the CLR header, the Metadata, the MSIL Code, and 
Native code.  
CLR header will be used by the managed code in the module which will have the version 
number of the CLR on which the module is built and entry point method of the module in 
the executable.  
Metadata describes the types used in the managed code, combination of CLR header and 
MSIL Code is the compiled format of a .Net language on a .Net Compiler, which will not 
have the instruction in targeted machine instruction format, which will again get 
compiled by the JIT Compiler 
Native Code contains the machine instruction, which will be directly executed by the OS. 
Not all the .NET PE will have the Native code. PE of type EXE’s will be having a native 
method like main() called as “unmanaged stub” which will be an entry point for the OS to 
execute code, that function will jump to _CorExeMain function located in MSCoree.dll 
which will be executed by the OS to initialize CLR and attach the running .NET module 
to CLR. Once CLR is initialized and loaded CLR will start executing the assembly by 
executing the managed entry point function specified in the CLR header of the file. 
Managed Code 
Machine instructions in MSIL format and located in Assemblies will be executed by the 
CLR, will have the following intrinsic advantages, 
Memory management to prevent memory leaks in the program code, 
• Thread execution, 
• Code safety verification, 
• Compilation, 
Executed on many platforms like Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000,and other 
system services. 
Managed methods will be marked as “cil” in MSIL code. Methods marked with “cil” will 
be compiled by mscorjit.dll before execution. C# and VB.NET will generate only 
managed code. (Managed C++ can generate managed code by specifying “#pragma 
managed”) 
Unmanaged Code 
Unmanaged codes are the instructions, which are targeted for specific platforms. 
Unmanaged code will exist in any of the format, 
A code instructions in managed C++ with “#pragma unmanaged” 
COM/COM+ Components 
Win32 Dlls/System Dlls 
As these codes are in native format of OS, these instructions will be executed faster 
compared with JIT compilation and execution of Managed code. 
Managed and Unmanaged transitions 
As we get more benefits from managed code, still we may need to use unmanaged code. 
.Net provides many ways to access unmanaged code in managed code. Managed
Unmanaged transitions are achieved in .Net by set of services called Platform Invocation 
Services (P/Invoke) and IJW(It Just Works). 
P/Invoke services are targeted for unmanaged code, which exists as COM/COM+ 
components and Win32 DLLs. COM/COM+ components will accessed by the concept 
called COM Interop - is a mechanism in which existing COM components will be 
accessed through a wrapper class called COM Callable Wrapper (CCW) in managed code 
without modifying the existing COM components. Using P/Invoke mechanism we can 
call Windows DLL functions in managed code. 
IJW(It Just Works) targets code instructions built on C++ managed extensions, This 
mechanism is only for the code in Managed C++. In this way we can call the unmanaged 
methods directly by the managed code. 
For example following code calls the MessageBox function in User32.dll(VB.NET) 
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices 
Public Class Win32 
Declare Auto Function MessageBox Lib "user32.dll" (ByVal 
hWnd As Integer, _ 
ByVal txt As String, ByVal caption As String, ByVal Typ As 
Integer) As Integer 
End Class 
Module Module1 
Sub Main() 
         Win32.MessageBox(0, 
"Hello world" , "Temp path 
End Module 
is", 0) 
End Sub 
Declare is the statement to state the Win32 API functions located in the Win32 DLLs. 
And the respective arguments declared with CLR data type. 
In C#, we need to use the extern keyword with the attribute DLL Import to specify the 
Win32 DLL and the function should be declared as static function. 
using System; 
class PInvokeDemo  
{ 
[dllimport("user32.dll")] 
public static extern int MessageBox(int hwnd, string msg, 
string caption, int type); 
public static int Main()   
 { 
MessageBox(0, "Hello World!", "Tutorial", 1); 
return 0; 
 } 
} 
In the above example MessageBox function is accessed from user32.dll by using the 
attribute DLL Import, and declared as static function 
Managed Types and Unmanaged Types 
We have seen how to call an unmanaged code in a managed code, now the question is 
how unmanaged code understands the managed data type and vice the versa. We will see 
how string will be sent from managed code and returned back to managed code. When 
passing a string value as an input argument to an unmanaged code CLR will take care of 
converting that to a native string type.  
When we try to call a function, which returns string then the managed code, has to 
allocate memory and send to the function in unmanaged code. For example if we want to 
retrieve the OS Temp path then we can call GetTempPath API function of “kernel32.dll”,  
Following code snippet shows how to call the function with string as an out argument 
with VB.NET. 
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices 
Public Class Win32 
Declare 
Auto 
Function
 MessageBox 
Lib 
"user32.dll" (ByVal hWnd As Integer, _ 
ByVal txt As String, ByVal caption As 
String, ByVal Typ As Integer) As Integer 
      Declare Auto Function GetTempPath Lib "kernel32.dll" 
(ByVal lenOfChar As Integer, ByVal strData As 
System.Text.StringBuilder) As Integer 
End Class 
Module Module1 
    Sub Main() 
        Dim l As Integer 
        Dim data As String 
  Dim tempPath As System.Text.StringBuilder = New                 
System.Text.StringBuilder(255) 
        l = 255 
        Win32.GetTempPath(l, tempPath) 
        Win32.MessageBox(0, tempPath.ToString(), "Temp path 
is", 0) 
    End Sub 
End Module 
 
Following code snippet shows how to call the function with string as an out 
argument with C#. 
using System; 
using System.Text; 
class PInvokeDemo  
{ 
[ dllimport("kernel32") ] 
public static extern int GetTempPath ( int size, 
StringBuilder buf ); 
     
 public static int Main()  
 { 
  const int size = 255; 
  StringBuilder tempPath = new StringBuilder ( size 
);  
  GetTempPath ( size, tempPath ); 
  System.Console.WriteLine ( tempPath ); 
  return 0; 
 } 
} 
The above code uses StringBuilder class of System.Text namespace to allocate string 
with 255 characters (Just think for this as a fixed string we used to have in VB). 
Some of the functions in managed code will be accepting arguments as structures, 
structures in unmanaged code will be having set of member fields located in memory as 
the order in which it has been declared, that is the layout of member variable location is 
fixed. But in .Net, structures will have fields of managed data type and these member 
fields will automatically change the memory location of the structure. CLR will 
automatically move the data members to improve memory usage and performance.  
When an unmanaged method, which expects an argument as a structure, then managed 
code has to declare the structure so that it can be accessed by the unmanaged code. But 
.NET structures will have auto memory layout of data members, so to pass structures 
from managed code to unmanaged code has to be declared with an attribute StructLayout 
in System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace. 
StructLayout is used with an enumerated value LayoutKind with following options given 
below: 
• Auto – default option which changes the member field memory layout. 
• Sequential - specifies member variable should be placed in a sequential order as 
specified while declaring the type. 
• Explicit- specifies the exact location of the member variable in the structure. 
3.5 Summary 
Over the course of topics covered in this session you have seen how to create a simple 
HelloWorld program, to know the internals of the .NET Framework Runtime. For further 
understanding or clarification you can always use the .NET framework SDK help 
documentation and MSDN online. 
4. Language Features of C# 
Section Owner: Gurneet Singh (MVP)
Content Contributors: Amit Kukreja
, Arvind Rangan
, Reshmi Nair
4.1 History of C# 
.NET framework offers a myriad of languages which puts us programmers into a deep 
thought process about which programming language best suits our needs. 
Which language is the "best" language choice? If you are a VB wizard, should you take 
the time to learn C# or continue to use VB.NET? Are C# ASP.NET pages "faster" than 
VB .NET ASP.NET pages? These are questions that you may find yourself asking, 
especially when you're just starting to delve into .NET. Fortunately the answer is simple: 
there is no "best" language. All .NET languages use, at their root, functionality from the 
set of classes provided by the .NET Framework. Therefore, everything you can do in 
VB.NET you can do in C#, and vice-a-versa.  
The differences occur in three main areas: syntax, object-oriented principles, and the 
Visual Studio .NET IDE. Syntax concerns the statements and language elements. Object 
Oriented differences are less obvious, and concern differences in implementation and 
feature sets between the two languages. IDE differences include things like compiler 
settings or attributes. There is also a fourth area of difference: language features that are 
present in one language but have no equivalent in the other.  
If you are more familiar with Java, JScript, or C/C++, you may find C#'s syntax more 
familiar than VB.NET's.  
A good question that has to be answered in order to keep you interested in learning C# is 
Why should you learn another programming language when you already doing enterprise 
development in C++ or Java. The very answer at the first go will be C# is intended to be 
the premier language for writing NGWS (Next Generation of Windows Services) 
applications in the enterprise computing world. 
The programming language C# derives from C and C++; however apart from being 
entirely object oriented it is type safe and simple too. If you are a C/C++ programmer 
your learning curve should be flat. Many C# statements including expressions and 
operators have been taken directly taken from your favourite language 
An important point about C# is that it simplifies and modernizes C++ in the areas of 
classes, namespaces and exception handling. Much of complex features have not been 
included or in fact hidden in C# to make it easer to use and more importantly less error 
prone for e.g. no more macros, templates and no multiple inheritances (Few of you might 
not like it.) 
C# provides you with convenient features like garbage collection, versioning and lot 
more. 
The only expense that I can think of is that your code operates in safe mode, where no 
pointers are allowed. However if you want to use pointers you are not restricted from 
using it via unsafe code- and no marshalling is involved when calling the unsafe code. 
So you will learn a great deal of this new language in the coming Sections and see for 
yourself that how C# resembles or not resembles your favorite language 
4.2 Language Fundamentals in C# 
Constants & Variables 
A variable is a named memory location. They are programming elements that can change 
during program execution. Data that needs to be stored in memory & accessed at a later 
time are stored in variables. Instead of referring to the memory location by the actual 
memory address you refer to it with a variable name.  
Variables are declared as follows  
int a; 
They can also be initialized at the time of declaration as follows: 
int a = 10; 
Constants are very similar to variables. The main difference is that the value contained in 
memory cannot be changed once the constant is declared. When you declare a constant 
its value is also specified and this value cannot be changed during program execution.  
Constants are used in situations where we need to keep the value in some memory 
location constant. If you use hard-coded values, and the value is changed then it has to be 
changed in all the locations in the code where it has been used. Instead if we are using 
constants, all we will need to do is to change the value of the constant. This would 
propagate the changes to our entire application.   
Constants are declared as follows 
const int a;  
Simple Types (Primitive Data types) 
Simple or value type variables are those, which are assigned space in the stack instead of 
the heap. All the primitive types such as int, double etc are value type variables. The 
simple types basically consist of Boolean and Numeric types, where Numeric is further 
divided into Integral and Floating Point. 
The first rule of value types is that they cannot be null. Anytime you declare a variable of 
value type, you have allocated the number of bytes associated with that type on the stack 
and are working directly with that allocated array of bits. In addition, when you pass a 
variable of value type, you are passing that variable’s value and not a reference to the 
underlying object. 
Object Type 
Object type or reference type variables are those, which are allocated storage space in the 
heap. Reference type objects can be null. When a reference type is allocated under the 
covers a value is allocated on the heap and a reference to that value is returned. There are 
basically four reference types: classes, interfaces, delegates and arrays. 
Class Type   
Custom data types are available in .NET framework in the form of classes or class type. It 
is nothing but a set of data and related behavior that is defined by the developer.  
Object type and class type are both reference type variables. The only difference comes 
from the fact that object type consists of objects predefined and available with the .NET 
framework such as string whereas class type consists of custom user defined data types 
such as the class employee given below. 
class employee 
{ 
int empid; 
string empname 
public employee() 
{ 
   empid = 10; 
   empname = “Reshmi”; 
} 
} 
Overloading and Overriding of the Class
Overloading provides the ability to create multiple methods or properties with the same 
name, but with different parameters lists. This is a feature of polymorphism. A simple 
example would be an addition function, which will add the numbers if two integer 
parameters are passed to it and concatenate the strings if two strings are passed to it. 
 
using System; 
public class test 
{ 
public int Add(int x , int y) 
{ 
 return(x + y); 
} 
public string Add(String x, String y  ) 
{ 
return (x + y); 
} 
public static void Main() 
 {  
   test a = new test (); 
   int b; 
   String c; 
   b = a.Add(1, 2); 
   c = a.Add("Reshmi", " Nair"); 
   Console.WriteLine(b); 
   Console.WriteLine(c); 
 } 
} 
 
O/P:

Overriding  
Class inheritance causes the methods and properties present in the base class also to be 
derived into the derived class. A situation may arise wherein you would like to change 
the functionality of an inherited method or property. In such cases we can override the 
method or property of the base class. This is another feature of polymorphism.  
 
public abstract class shapes 
{ 
 public abstract void display() 
 { 
  Console.WriteLine("Shapes"); 
 } 
} 
 
 
public class square: shapes 
{ 
 public override void display() 
 { 
  Console.WriteLine("This is a square"); 
  } 
} 
 
public class rectangle:shapes 
{ 
public override void display()  
{ 
 Console.WriteLine("This is a rectangle"); 
 } 
} 
 
The above example is just an indication to how overriding can be implemented in C#. 
 
Properties 
 
Properties are named members of classes, structs, and interfaces. They provide a flexible 
mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields through accessors. 
Properties are an extension of fields and are accessed using the same syntax. Unlike 
fields, properties do not designate storage locations. Instead, properties have accessors 
that read, write, or compute their values.  
Get accessor 
The execution of the get accessor is equivalent to reading the value of the field.  
The following is a get accessor that returns the value of a private field name: 
private string name;   // the name field 
public string Name   // the Name property 
{ 
   get  
   { 
      return name;  
   } 
} 
Set accessor 
The set accessor is similar to a method that returns void. It uses an implicit parameter 
called value, whose type is the type of the property. In the following example, a set 
accessor is added to the Name property: 
public string Name  
{ 
  return name;  
 get  
 {  
 { 
 } 
 set  
  name = value;  
 } 
} 
When you assign a value to the property, the set accessor is invoked with an argument 
that provides the new value. For example: 
e1.Name = "Reshmi";   // The set accessor is invoked here 
It is an error to use the implicit parameter name (value) for a local variable declaration in 
a set accessor. 
How to make a Property Read Only/Write Only 
There are times when we may want a property to be read-only – such that it can’t be 
changed. 
This is where read-only properties come into the picture. A Read Only property is one 
which includes only the get accessor, no set accessor. 
public  read Only int empid  
{ 
  return empid;  
 get  
 {  
 } 
} 
Similar to read-only properties there are also situations where we would need 
something known as write-only properties. In this case the value can be changed 
but not retrieved. To create a write-only property, use the WriteOnly keyword and 
only implement the set block in the code as shown in the example below. 
public  writeOnly int e  
{ 
  e = value 
 set 
 {  
 } 
} 
Structures
A structure allows you to create your own custom data types and it contains one or more 
members that can be of different data types. It can contain fields, methods, etc. 
Structures are very similar to classes but there are some restrictions present in the case of 
structures that are absent in the case of classes. For example you cannot initialize 
structure members. Also you cannot inherit a structure whereas classes can be inherited. 
Another important feature of structures differentiating it from classes is that a structure 
can't have a default parameter-less constructor or a destructor. A structure is created on 
the stack and dies when you reach the closing brace in C# or the End structure in 
VB.NET. 
 
But one of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures 
are referenced by value and classes by reference. As a value type, allocated on the stack, 
structs provide a significant opportunity to increase program efficiency. Objects on the 
stack are faster to allocate and de-allocate. A struct is a good choice for data-bound 
objects, which don’t require too much memory. The memory requirements should be 
considered based on the fact that the size of memory available on the stack is limited than 
the memory available on the heap.  
Thus we must use classes in situations where large objects with lots of logic are required. 
 
Struct – Code: Sample code showing the Class vs. Structures 
 
using System; 
class Test {  
int classvar ; 
int anothervar =20; 
public Test ( ) 
{ 
classvar = 28; 
} 
 public static void Main() 
{ 
Test  t  = new Test(); 
ExampleStruct strct = new ExampleStruct(20); 
System.Console.WriteLine(strct.i); 
strct.i = 10; 
System.Console.WriteLine(t.classvar); 
System.Console.WriteLine(strct.i); 
strct.trialMethod(); 
} 
} 
 
struct ExampleStruct { 
 public int i; 
 public ExampleStruct(int j)  
{ 
  i = j; 
 } 
 public void trialMethod()

             Inside Trial Method 
In the above example, I have declared and used a constructor with a single parameter for 
a structure. Instead if I had tried to use a default parameter-less parameter I would have 
got an error. But the same is possible in the case of classes as shown by the default 
parameter-less constructor, which initializes the classvar variable to 28. 
Another point to note is that a variable called anothervar has been declared and initialized 
within the class whereas the same cannot be done for members of a structure. 
Why Namespaces
Namespaces are used in .Net to organize class libraries into a hierarchical structure and 
reduce conflicts between various identifiers in a program. By helping organize classes, 
namespaces help programmers manage their projects efficiently and in a meaningful way 
that is understood by consumers of the class library. Namespaces enables reusable 
components from different companies to be used in the same program without the worry 
of ambiguity caused by multiple instances of the same identifier. 
Namespaces provide a logical organization for programs to exist. Starting with a top
level namespace, sub-namespaces are created to further categorize code, based upon its 
purpose. 
In .Net, the base class library begins at the System namespace. There are several classes 
at the System level such as Console, Exception etc. The namespace name gives a good 
idea of the types of classes that are contained within the namespace. The fully qualified 
name of a class is the class name prefixed with the namespace name. There are also 
several nested namespaces within the System namespace such as System.Security, 
System.IO, System.Data, System.Collections etc.  
Reducing conflict is the greatest strength of namespaces. Class and method names often 
collide when using multiple libraries. This risk increases as programs get larger and 
include more third-party tools. 
Boxing Conversions
Boxing is the implicit conversion of a value type to a reference type or to any interface 
type implemented by this value type. This is possible due to the principle of type system 
unification where everything is an object. 
When boxing occurs, the contents of value type are copied from the stack into the 
memory allocated on the managed heap. The new reference type created contains a copy 
of the value type and can be used by other types that expect an object reference. The 
value contained in the value type and the created reference types are not associated in any 
way. If you change the original value type, the reference type is not affected. Boxing, 
thus, enables everything to appear to be an object, thereby avoiding the overhead required 
if everything actually were an object. 
Example:    
int n = 10; 
Object obj; 
obj = n; 
Explanation: 
In the above code segment, a value-type variable n is declared and is assigned the value 
10. The next statement declares an object-type variable obj. The last statement implicitly 
performs boxing operation on the variable n.  
UnBoxing Conversions
UnBoxing is the explicit conversion from a reference type to a value type or from an 
interface type to a value type that implements the interface. 
When unboxing occurs, memory is copied from the managed heap to the stack. For an 
unboxing conversion to a given value type to succeed at run time, the value of the source 
argument must be a reference to an object that was previously created by boxing a value 
of that value type otherwise an exception is thrown. 
Example:  
int n = 10; 
int j; 
Object obj; 
obj = n; 
j = (int)obj; 
Explanation: 
In the above code segment, another integer variable j is declared. The last statement 
performs explicit conversion of object-type to value-type i.e. integer. 
Boxing and UnBoxing have performance implications. Every time a value type is boxed, 
a new reference type is created and the value type is copied onto the managed heap. 
Depending on the size of the value type and the number of times value types are boxed 
and unboxed, the CLR can spend a lot of CPU cycles just doing these conversions. 
It is recommended to perform boxing and unboxing in a scenario where you have to pass 
a value parameter multiple times to a method that accepts a reference parameter. In such 
a case, it is advantageous to box the value parameter once before passing it multiple times 
to methods that accept reference methods. 
Enumerations
Enumerations are types that inherit from System.Enum. The elements of an enumeration 
are expressed in words rather than numbers, which makes it convenient for understanding 
the meaning of the value being used. Enumerations symbolically represent a set of values 
of one of the primitive integral types. 
The type of the elements of an enumeration can be byte, short, int or long. If no type is 
specified explicitly, the default type is int.  
Example: 
enum month : byte 
{Jan = 2, Feb = 5, Mar = 10}; 
Explanation: 
In the above code segment, an enumeration type month is declared. The underlying type 
of the elements has been specified as byte. It has three elements viz: Jan, Feb and Mar. 
These three elements have been assigned specific values. In case of an enumeration, if no 
values are specified, the value of the first element corresponds to 0 and so on. 
Delegates
The runtime supports constructs called delegates, which enable late-bound operations 
such as method invocation and callback procedures. With delegates, a program can 
dynamically call different methods at runtime. They are type safe, secure, managed 
objects that always point to a valid object and cannot corrupt the memory of another 
object. The closest equivalent of a delegate in other languages is a function pointer, but 
whereas a function pointer can only reference static functions, a delegate can reference 
both static and instance methods. Delegates are Marshal by Value Objects.   
The members of a delegate are the members inherited from class System.Delegate.  
A delegate defines the signature and return type of a method. The resulting delegate can 
reference any method with a matching signature. Each instance of a delegate can forward 
a call to one or more methods that take those parameters and return the same type. Once a 
method has been assigned to a delegate, it is called when the delegate is invoked.  
Example: 
public delegate int calculation(int a,int b); 
class mainclass 
{ 
 calculation calc_delegate; 
            public int add(int num1,int num2) 
 { 
return num1 + num2; 
 } 
            static void Main() 
 { 
   int result; 
   mainclass obj = new mainclass(); 
   obj.calc_delegate = new calculation(obj.add); 
   result = obj.calc_delegate(50,70); 
           } 
} 
Explanation: 
Four steps are required to implement delegates viz. 
• Defining Delegates 
The foremost step is to define the delegate. The definition of the delegate specifies 
the method signature, return type of the method, access modifier and the delegate 
name. The method signature specifies the order and type of each argument.  
The definition of a delegate is indicated by the usage of the delegate keyword. As 
shown in the above code segment, the delegate name is calculation, it's access 
modifier is public, it receives two integer arguments and returns an integer value.  
• Creating Delegate Method Handler(s) 
The next step is to define the method(s) that will be associated with the delegate. 
In the above code segment, a method named add is defined. This method must have  
same method signature as that of the delegate, as shown in the above code segment.  
• Hooking up Delegates and Method Handlers 
For a delegate method handler to be invoked, it must be assigned to a delegate object.  
In the above code, the delegate object is calc_delegate and is hooked up to the 
method handler add.   
• Invoking the method through the Delegate 
The last step is to invoke the methods that are associated with the delegate. A 
delegate method handler is invoked by making a method call on the delegate itself. 
This causes the method handler to invoke with the assigned input parameters as if 
they were invoked directly by the program, as shown in the above code.  
4.3 Control Statements  
C# has statements such as if ….. else …..  and switch…case which help you to 
conditionally execute program. 
C# provides you with various looping statements, such as do… while, while, for and 
foreach….in. 
1. The if ….else….. Statement 
Consider a student marks and grade evaluation. For Marks above 75 the grade is ‘A’ and 
for below 75 is ‘B’. In this situation when you need to execute some code based on some 
condition, you can make use of, if …. else …... 
The Cultural syntax normally used is as follows: 
if (condition) 
{ 
} 
else 
 { 
} 
Executable statements when the condition is True 
Executable statements when the Condition is False 
OR using else if for Advanced Decision making  
if (condition) 
{ 
} 
Executable statements 
 e
lse if (condition) 
{ 
} 
Executable statements 
Single if can have multiple else if with conditions, as mentioned above in else if format.  
Nesting if …else Constructs 
if (condition) 
{ 
if (condition) 
{ 
Executable statements when the condition2 is TRUE 
} 
else 
 { 
  Executable Statements 
} 
else 
{ 
} 
Executable statements 
One important thing to keep in mind when nesting if…else constructs is that you must have remember to close the 
brace ({  }) for every brace that you open. 
2. The switch…case Statement. 
The switch statement is a control statement that handles multiple selections by passing 
control to one of the case statements within its body. 
The switch…case Statement is similar to if…else. The only difference between two is 
that if and else if can evaluate different expressions in each statement, but the switch 
statement can evaluate only one expression. 
The drawback of if...else construct is that it isn’t capable of handling a decision situation 
without a lot of extra work. One such situation is when you have to perform different 
actions based on numerous possible values of an expression, not just True or False. For 
instance performing actions based on Students Grade. 
if ( Grade.Equals (“A”)) 
{  
……. 
} 
else if (Grade.Equals (“B”)) 
{  
…… 
} 
else if (Grade.Equals (“C”)) 
{  
…… 
}  
else if (Grade.Equals (“D”)) 
{  
…… 
} 
else 
{ 
.…. 
} 
As you see the structure can be a bit hard to read and if the conditions increase you may 
end up writing a confusing and an unreadable piece of Code 
The switch uses the result of an expression to execute different set of statements. 
The syntax for the select…case Statement is as follows: 
switch (expression) 
{ 
case constant-expression: 
statement 
  jump-statement 
default: 
  statement 
  jump-statement] 
}  
Notice that the jump-statement is required after each block, including the last block 
whether it is a case statement or a default statement. 
Note: default is used to define the code that executes only when the expression 
doesn’t evaluate to any of the values in case Statements .Use of default case is 
optional 
Let’s see the same example as above but this time with switch case. 
switch(grade)  
{ 
 case  “A”:  
             Executable statements 
             jump-statement 
case  “B”: 
       Executable statements 
             jump-statement 
case  “C”: 
             Executable statements 
             jump-statement 
case  “D”: 
             Executable statements 
             jump-statement 
default : 
             Executable statements 
             jump-statement 
} 
Branching is performed using jump statements, which cause an immediate transfer of the 
program control.(break, continue, default ,goto ,return) 
Evaluating More than one possible Value in a case Statement is not possible in C#, 
but VB.Net does allow evaluating more than one Value. 
3. for Statements.  
The for loop executes a statement or a block of statements repeatedly until a specified 
expression evaluates to false. 
for ([initializers]; [expression]; [iterators]) statement   
where:  
Initializers: A comma separated list of expressions or assignment statements to initialize 
the loop counters.  
Expression : expression is used to test the loop-termination criteria.  
Iterators : Expression statement(s) to increment or decrement the loop counters.  
Example print numbers from 1 To 100 
for (int intctr =1; intctr <= 100; intctr++)  
Debug.WriteLine(intctr); 
This routine starts a loop with a for statement after a variable intctr is declared. This loop 
initializes intctr to 1 and then prints 1 through 100 to the output window.  
Note:  you can declare variable in the Initialization part of the for loop separated by 
comma. 
Example : print even number from 1 to 100 
for(int i=2; i <= 100; i = i + 2) 
 Debug.WriteLine(i.ToString()); 
Example : To Sum the total of all number from 1 to 10 
for( i =1 ; i < 11 ; i++) 
sum = sum + i ; 
Example : The statement below can be used as an infinite loop. 
for ( ; ; ); 
 
 
Example of use of for loop. 
Let us see how to a write table of 2 using for loop. 
 
 
for(int j = 1,i = 2; j <= 10; j++) 
Debug.WriteLine("2 X " +  j.ToString() + " = " + i*j ); 
 
Output: 
2 X 1 = 2 
.. 
.. 
.. 
.. 
.. 
… 
2 X 10 = 20 
 
 
An Example of Nested For loop. 
 
Let us write a small code to display a structure of stars ‘*’ in triangle format. 
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * * 
 
Let us have a label with name stars. Increase the height of the label to get a clear view of 
the image. 
 
string star=""; 
for(int i = 0; i < 5 ;i++) // First loop to count the rows 
{ 
for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++)  // Second loop to count 
the columns 
 { 
star = star + " * "; 
 } 
Debug.WriteLine(star);  
star = ""; 
} 
 
 
Note:  For better readability you must always indent your 
Codes. 
4. foreach…in Statement 
The foreach…in Statement is used to repeat a set of statements for each element in an 
array or collection. 
The foreach…in statement is executed if there is at least one item in an array of 
collection. The Loop repeats of each element in an array or collection. 
The syntax for the foreach…in statement as follows: 
foreach (type Component in Set )  
 { 
Executable statements 
} 
Component is the variable used to refer to the elements of an array or a collection. 
Set refers to an array or any collection object. 
e.g. 
string[]  weeks  = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
"Thursday", 
   "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"}; 
      foreach(string eachday in weeks) 
 { 
            MessageBox.Show(eachday); 
}         
An example for using foreach element in a collection of string into a single string 
element.  
Each element of array which is of type string is read from the collection and stored into 
the single string type object. 
5. while…Statement 
The while… Statement is used to repeat set of executable statements as long as the 
condition is true. 
The syntax for the while… statement is as follows: 
while (Condition) 
{  
Executable Statements 
  } 
   
In this if the condition is satisfied then the statements are executed. Else it will not enter 
the while condition at all.  
 
example of infinite loop is  
while (true); 
 
Example print numbers from 1 to 100 
int i = 1; 
while ( i <= 100) 
{ 
 Debug.WriteLine(i.ToString()); 
 i++; 
} 
 
Example print even numbers from 1 to 100 
Int i = 2; 
While( i <=100) 
{ 
 Debug.WriteLine(i.ToString()); 
 i = i + 2; 
} 
 
 
6. do...while Statement 
 
The do...while Statement is similar to while… Statement.  
 
do  
{ 
 Statements to Execute 
} 
while (condition) 
 
example print numbers from 1 to 100 
int i = 1; 
do 
{ 
 Debug.WriteLine(i.ToString()); 
 i++; 
}while( i  <= 100); 
 
example print even numbers from 1 to 100 
int i = 2; 
do 
{ 
 Debug.WriteLine(i.ToString()); 
 i = i + 2; 
}while( i  <= 100); 
 
 
A Complete Example with set of control statements. 
 
We will create a C# application, which will accept students name and its grade. 
Depending upon the type of grade it will add remarks. 
 
 
int value=0, ctr=0; 
 
//Accept a number from the user 
Console.Write("Enter the number of students : ");  
value = Int32.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); 
  
 
string [] arrName= new string[value]; 
string sGrade =""; 
string [] arrRemarks= new string[value]; 
 
while (ctr < value) 
{ 
 //Accept the name of the students 
Console.Write("Enter the name of the Student" + (ctr + 
1) + " : ");  
 arrName[ctr] = Console.ReadLine();  
    
 //Accept the grade of the Student 
 Console.Write("Enter the grade of the student  
A/B/C/D/F : " );  
 sGrade = Console.ReadLine();   
 
 // Assign remarks to  students 
 switch (sGrade.ToUpper()) 
 { 
  case "A": 
   arrRemarks[ctr] = "Excellent"; 
   break; 
  case "B": 
   arrRemarks[ctr] = "Good"; 
   break; 
  case "C": 
   arrRemarks[ctr] = "Fair"; 
   break; 
  case "D": 
   arrRemarks[ctr] = "Poor"; 
   break; 
  case "F": 
   arrRemarks[ctr] = "Fail"; 
   break; 
  default: 
   Console.WriteLine("Incorrect value entered 
"); 
   return; // To come out of the program 
 } 
  
ctr = ctr + 1; 
} 
 
// Display the summary on the Console 
for (ctr = 0 ;ctr< value; ctr=ctr+1) 
{ 
      if (arrRemarks[ctr].Equals("fail")) 
 { 
  Console.WriteLine(arrName[ctr] + " has failed in_ 
exams "); 
 } 
      else 
 { 
      Console.WriteLine(arrName[ctr] +  "'s 
performance is " +  arrRemarks[ctr]); 
} 
                 
} 
 
 
Note use of ToUpper() and ToLower() used to Convert all alphabetic characters have 
been converted to Upper Case / Lower Case . 
 
 
  
 
4.4 Arrays 
Till now we have been using variable to store values. We might come across a situation 
when we might need to store multiple values of similar type. Such as names of 100 
students in a school. One way to do it is to declare 100 variables and store all the names. 
A much more simple and efficient way of storing these variable is using Arrays. An 
Array is a memory location that is used to store multiple values. 
All the values in an array are of the same type, such as int or string and are referenced by 
their index or subscript number, which is the order in which these values are stored in the 
array. These values are called the elements of the array. 
The number of elements that an array contains is called the length of the array. 
In C# all arrays are inherited from the System.Array Class. 
Arrays can be single or multidimensional. You can determine the dimensions of an array 
by the number of subscripts that are used to identify the position of any array element. 
A single dimensional array is identified by only a single subscript and an element in a 
two-dimensional array is identified by two subscripts. 
Arrays in C# also support the concept of Jagged Arrays. 
The dimension has to be declared before using them in a program. The array declaration 
comprises the name of the array and the number of elements the array can contain. 
The Syntax of single dimension array is as follows. 
Datatype [] ArrayName  = new DataType[number of elements]; 
e.g. 
string [] studentname = new string [5]; 
You can assign the values at runtime or even at the design time. 
Design time declaration: 
Studentname [0]=”Rohan” 
Studentname [1]=”Mohan” 
….. 
Studentname[10]=”Nitin” 
All arrays starts with the index of 0 i.e. All arrays are Zero Based. This implies that above 
array can store 10 elements. Here 0, is the starting index or the lower bound of the array 
and  9 is the upper bound while the length of the array is 10.  
 
 
 
 
Example 1. 
 
We will create a C# Console Application that will accept the names of students in an 
single dimension array and display it back. 
 
 
int value = 0,  cnt = 0; 
 
//Accept how many students names to enter 
Console.Write("Enter the number of students name to enter: 
"); 
value = System.Int32.Parse(Console.ReadLine()) ; 
     
 
string[] arrnames = new string [value]; 
 
for(cnt = 0; cnt<value;cnt++) 
{ 
Console.Write("Enter the name of student " + (cnt + 1) 
+  ":", "Student Name"); 
 arrnames[cnt] = Console.ReadLine(); 
} 
 
Console.WriteLine("Pulling Values from the Array"); 
 
//Display the entered value to the text box 
for(cnt = 0; cnt < value; cnt++) 
{ 
 Console.WriteLine(arrnames[cnt]);  
} 
 
Above example will accept number of names to be entered and will add the names in a 
loop and then redisplay it on the Console. Note that we have not written any error 
handling code that is left to the reader as an exercise. 
 
The Syntax for multi-dimension arrays is as follows: 
Previously we saw how we can store multiple names of students. But, if we want to store 
related data of students like first name, middle name, last name. In such situations you 
can use multi dimension arrays, such as two-or-three dimension arrays. 
 
Datatype [] ArrayName  = new Datatype[number of 1st element, 
number of 2nd element,….]; 
 
e.g. 
string[,] studentdetails = new string [10,2]; 
Index positions  of array elements. 
0,0 0,1 
1,0 1,1 
2,0 2,1 
3,0 3,1 
…  
10,0 10,1 
studentdetails(0,0) = “Manoj”  
studentdetails(0,1) = “Malik” 
To display “Malik” we need to use the index position of the array and say , 
Studentdetails [0,1]. 
Example 2. 
We will create a C# Console Application, which will accept Student Name, Address and 
city name and display it on the Console. 
string [,] arrsummary = new string[3, 3]; 
int i=0, j=0; 
//As we wanted just 3 columns we have set it to 2, else if 
u want to be two only then while declaring the array make 
it (2,2) as the lower index is 0. 
for(i = 0;i<=2;i++) 
{ 
for(j = 0;j<=2;j++) 
 { 
Console.WriteLine("Enter the value for " + i + " 
row and " + j + " column, Summary"); 
arrsummary[i, j] = Console.ReadLine(); 
 } 
} 
Console.WriteLine(); 
//Display the values in the summary array. 
for(i = 0;i<=2;i++) 
{ 
 string s = ""; 
 for(j = 0;j<=2;j++) 
 { 
  if (s.Equals("")) 
  { 
   s =  arrsummary[i, j]; 
  } 
  else 
  { 
   s =  s + " - " + arrsummary[i, j]; 
  } 
 } 
 Console.WriteLine(s);  
} 
 
 
 
Jagged Arrays 
A jagged array is an array whose elements are arrays. The elements of a jagged array can 
be of different dimensions and sizes. A jagged array is sometimes called an "array-of
arrays." 
 
//Decalaring a Jagged Array 
int[][] myJaggedArray = new int[3][]; 
 
//Initialize the elements of the Jagged Array  
myJaggedArray[0] = new int[5]; 
myJaggedArray[1] = new int[4]; 
myJaggedArray[2] = new int[2]; 
 
//Fill array elements with values. 
myJaggedArray[0] = new int[] {1,3,5,7,9}; 
myJaggedArray[1] = new int[] {0,2,4,6}; 
myJaggedArray[2] = new int[] {11,22}; 
You can access individual array elements like these examples: 
// Assign 33 to the second element of the first array: 
myJaggedArray[0][1] = 33; 
// get the value of second element of the third array: 
int i = myJaggedArray[2][1]; 
 
 
Few Important methods in arrays. 
 
GetUpperBound(), GetLowerBound() are the  functions used to get the bound  of a 
array. These methods of the array class. You can use it with single dimension as well as 
for multi-dimensional arrays. 
GetLowerBound() is to get the upper limit of an array. 
GetUpperBound is to get the lower limit of an array. 
e.g. 
string[]  weeks  = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
   "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"}; 
MessageBox.Show(weeks.GetUpperBound(0).ToString());    
//the above statement returns 6 as the upper bound for the array weeks. 
Syntax : arrayname.GetUpperBound/GetLowerBound(dimension) 
Dimension  refers to the which upper/lower bound should be found, 0 for first, 1 for 
second and so on. 
e.g. 
string [,,] student_details = new string[10,20,15]; 
int upperlimit = 0; 
// This will return 10 for the 1st row element 
upperlimit = student_details.GetUpperBound(0); 
MessageBox.Show(upperlimit.ToString()); 
// This will return 20 for the 2nd row of element 
upperlimit = student_details.GetUpperBound(1);  
MessageBox.Show(upperlimit.ToString()); 
For all GetLowerBound(dimension) it will return 0 as the base lower bound is zero in 
.NET 
5. Language Features of VB.NET 
Section Owner: Gurneet Singh (MVP)
Content Contributors: Amit Kukreja
, Arvind Rangan
, Reshmi Nair
5.1 History of VB.NET  
.NET framework offers a myriad of languages which puts us programmers into a deep 
thought process about which programming language best suits our needs. 
Which language is the "best" language choice? If you are a VB wizard, should you take 
the time to learn C# or continue to use VB.NET? Are C# ASP.NET pages "faster" than 
VB.NET ASP.NET pages? These are questions that you may find yourself asking, 
especially when you're just starting to delve into .NET. Fortunately the answer is simple: 
there is no "best" language. All .NET languages use, at their root, functionality from the 
set of classes provided by the .NET Framework. Therefore, everything you can do in 
VB.NET you can do in C#, and vice-a-versa.  
The differences occur in three main areas: syntax, object-oriented principles, and the 
Visual Studio .NET IDE. Syntax concerns the statements and language elements. Object 
Oriented differences are less obvious, and concern differences in implementation and 
feature sets between the two languages. IDE differences include things like compiler 
settings or attributes. There is also a fourth area of difference: language features that are 
present in one language but have no equivalent in the other.  
If you are more familiar with Java, JScript, or C/C++, you may find C#'s syntax more 
familiar than VB.NET's.  
If you've been doing VB for the past five years, there's no reason to think you have to 
now switch to a new language (although you should always look to be learning new 
things). 
The fact is that VB.NET has all the facilities of VB such as not being case-sensitive, 
having the option of using IntelliSense etc in addition to which you have an ocean of new 
ideas & concepts thrown in for the benefit of programmers. 
VB has matured as a language and if you do not know it already, its almost 11 years since 
VB was born. It now provides all facilities for distributed computing and Internet 
programming for which it was not useful earlier. With VB.NET, due to the .NET 
framework all the classes and all the namespaces available with the other languages are 
made available to VB also. This is in addition to the drag and drop facility of building 
forms and web pages which was always the attraction in the use of VB. Thus it has the 
dual advantage of ease of use and the availability of advanced features. 
As already stated earlier both VB.NET and C# are equally powerful. So the primary 
reason for which VB could not reach the zenith of popularity has been eradicated and 
programmers who have been waiting for OOPs concepts to be incorporated into VB are 
rewarded with this offering of Microsoft. 
5.2 Language Fundamentals in VB.NET 
Constants &Variables 
A variable is a named memory location. They are programming elements that can change 
during program execution. Data that needs to be stored in memory & accessed at a later 
time are stored in variables. Instead of referring to the memory location by the actual 
memory address you refer to it with a variable name.  
Variables are declared as follows  
Dim a as Integer 
They can also be initialized at the time of declaration as follows: 
Dim a as Integer = 10 
Constants are very similar to variables. The main difference is that the value contained in 
memory cannot be changed once the constant is declared. When you declare a constant 
its value is also specified and this value cannot be changed during program execution.  
Constants are used in situations where we need to keep the value in some memory 
location constant. If you use hard-coded values, and the value is changed then it has to be 
changed in all the locations in the code where it has been used. Instead if we are using 
constants, all we will need to do is to change the value of the constant. This would 
propagate the changes to our entire application.   
Constants are declared as follows 
Const x as Integer  
VB.NET supports block-level scoping of variables. That is you can declare and use 
variables as and when you need them. Thus, if a variable is required within a ‘for’ block 
it can be declared within the block and its scope will be the end of the block.  
Simple Types (Primitive Data types) 
Simple or value type variables are those, which are assigned space in the stack instead of 
the heap. All the primitive types such as int, double etc are value type variables. The 
simple types basically consist of Boolean and Numeric types, where Numeric is further 
divided into Integral and Floating Point. 
The first rule of value types is that they cannot be null. Anytime you declare a variable of 
value type, you have allocated the number of bytes associated with that type on the stack 
and are working directly with that allocated array of bits. In addition, when you pass a 
variable of value type, you are passing that variable’s value and not a reference to the 
underlying object. 
Object Type 
Object type or reference type variables are those, which are allocated storage space in the 
heap. Reference type objects can be null. When a reference type is allocated under the 
covers a value is allocated on the heap and a reference to that value is returned. There are 
basically four reference types: classes, interfaces, delegates and arrays. 
Class Type  
Custom data types are available in .NET framework in the form of classes or class type. It 
is nothing but a set of data and related behavior that is defined by the developer.  
Object type and class type are both reference type variables. The only difference comes 
from the fact that object type consists of objects predefined and available with the .NET 
framework such as string whereas class type consists of custom user defined data types 
such as the Class Employee given below. 
Class Employee 
    Dim empid As Integer  
    Dim empname As String 
    Public Sub New() 
        empid = 10 
        empname = "Reshmi" 
    End Sub 
End Class 
Overloading and Overriding of the Class   
Overloading provides the ability to create multiple methods or properties with the same 
name, but with different parameters lists. This is a feature of polymorphism. It is 
accomplished by using the Overloads keyword in VB.NET. A simple example would be 
an addition function, which will add the numbers if two integer parameters are passed to 
it and concatenate the strings if two strings are passed to it. 
 
Class test 
 Public Overloads Function Add(ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As 
Integer) 
  Return x + y 
 End Function 
 
 Public Overloads Function Add(ByVal x As String, ByVal y As 
String) 
  Return x & y 
 End Function 
 
        Shared Sub main() 
  Dim a As new test 
  Dim b As Integer 
  Dim c As String 
  b = a.Add(1, 2) 
  c = a.Add("Reshmi", " Nair") 
  System.Console.Writeline(b) 
  System.Console.Writeline(c) 
 
 End Sub 
End Class 
 
O/P: 
3 
Reshmi Nair 
 
 
Overriding  
Class inheritance causes the methods and properties present in the base class also to be 
derived into the derived class. There might arise a situation wherein you would like to 
change the functionality of an inherited method or property. In such cases we can 
override the method or property of the base class. This is another feature of 
polymorphism. You can accomplish this in VB.NET by using the Overridable keyword 
with the base class method and the Overrides keyword with the derived class method.  
 
Public Class shapes 
        Public Overridable Sub display() 
            Console.WriteLine("Shapes") 
        End Sub 
 
    End Class 
 
    Public Class square 
        Inherits shapes 
 
        Public Overrides Sub display() 
            Console.WriteLine("This is a square") 
        End Sub 
    End Class 
    Public Class rectangle 
        Inherits shapes 
 
        Public Overrides Sub display() 
            Console.WriteLine("This is a rectangle") 
        End Sub 
    End Class 
The above example is just an indication to how overriding can be implemented in either 
VB.NET. 
 
Properties 
 
Properties are named members of classes, structs, and interfaces. They provide a flexible 
mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields through accessors. 
Properties are an extension of fields and are accessed using the same syntax. Unlike 
fields, properties do not designate storage locations. Instead, properties have accessors 
that read, write, or compute their values.  
 
Get accessor 
The execution of the get accessor is equivalent to reading the value of the field.  
 
The following is a get accessor that returns the value of a private field name: 
 
Dim name as String ’ the name field  
Property Name() As String ’ the name property 
 Get 
  Return name 
 End Get 
End Property 
 
Set accessor 
 
The set accessor is similar to a method that returns void. It uses an implicit parameter 
called value, whose type is the type of the property. In the following example, a set 
accessor is added to the Name property: 
 
Dim name as String ’ the name field  
Property Name() As String ’ the name property 
 Get 
  Return name 
 End Get 
Set(ByVal Value As String) 
End Property 
  Name = value 
 End Set 
When you assign a value to the property, the set accessor is invoked with an argument 
that provides the new value. For example: 
e1.Name = "Reshmi"   // The set accessor is invoked here 
It is an error to use the implicit parameter name (value) for a local variable declaration in 
a set accessor. 
How to make a Property Read Only/Write Only 
There are times when we may want a property to be read-only – such that it can’t be 
changed. This is where read-only properties come into the picture. A Read Only property 
is one which includes only the get accessor, no set accessor. 
For instance,  
Public ReadOnly Property EmpID() as Integer 
 Get  
End Property 
  Return empid 
 End Get 
Similar to read-only properties there are also situations where we would need something 
known as write-only properties. In this case the value can be changed but not retrieved. 
To create a write-only property, use the WriteOnly keyword and only implement the set 
block in the code as shown in the example below. 
Public WriteOnly Property e as string 
 Set 
  e 
= Value 
 End Set 
End Property 
Structures :  
A structure allows you to create your own custom data types and it contains one or more 
members that can be of different data types. It can contain fields, methods, Etc.,  
Structures are very similar to classes but there are some restrictions present in the case of 
structures that are absent in the case of classes. For example you cannot initialize 
structure members. Also you cannot inherit a structure whereas classes can be inherited. 
Another important feature of structures differentiating it from classes is that a structure 
can't have a default parameter-less constructor or a destructor. A structure is created on 
the stack and dies when you reach the closing brace in C# or the End structure in 
VB.NET. 
 
But one of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures 
are referenced by value and classes by reference. As a value type, allocated on the stack, 
structs provide a significant opportunity to increase program efficiency. Objects on the 
stack are faster to allocate and de-allocate. A struct is a good choice for data-bound 
objects, which don’t require too much memory. The memory requirements should be 
considered based on the fact that the size of memory available on the stack is limited than 
the memory available on the heap.  
Thus we must use classes in situations where large objects with lots of logic are required. 
 
Struct – Code: Sample code showing the Class vs. Structures 
 
Imports System 
 
Class Test 
 Dim classvar As Integer 
 Dim anothervar As Integer = 20  
 Sub New() 
  classvar = 28 
 End Sub 
 
 Structure ExampleStruct 
  Dim i As Integer 
  Sub New(ByVal j As Integer) 
   i = j 
  End Sub 
   
  Sub trialMethod() 
   Console.WriteLine("Inside Trial Method") 
  End Sub 
 
 End Structure 
 
 Shared Sub main() 
  Dim t As New Test() 
  Dim strct As New ExampleStruct(20) 
  Console.WriteLine(strct.i) 
  strct.i = 10 
  Console.WriteLine(t.classvar) 
  Console.WriteLine(strct.i) 
  strct.trialMethod() 
 End Sub 
 
End Class 
 
O/P: -  
28  
20 
10 
             Inside Trial Method 
In the above example, I have declared and used a constructor with a single parameter for 
a structure. Instead if I had tried to use a default parameter-less parameter I would have 
got an error. But the same is possible in the case of classes as shown by the default 
parameter-less constructor, which initializes the classvar variable to 28. 
Another point to note is that a variable called anothervar has been declared and initialized 
within the class whereas the same cannot be done for members of a structure. 
Why Namespaces
Namespaces are used in .Net to organize class libraries into a hierarchical structure and 
reduce conflicts between various identifiers in a program. By helping organize classes, 
namespaces help programmers manage their projects efficiently and in a meaningful way 
that is understood by consumers of the class library. Namespaces enables reusable 
components from different companies to be used in the same program without the worry 
of ambiguity caused by multiple instances of the same identifier. 
Namespaces provide a logical organization for programs to exist. Starting with a top
level namespace, sub-namespaces are created to further categorize code, based upon its 
purpose. 
In .Net, the base class library begins at the System namespace. There are several classes 
at the System level such as Console, Exception etc. The namespace name gives a good 
idea of the types of classes that are contained within the namespace. The fully qualified 
name of a class is the class name prefixed with the namespace name. There are also 
several nested namespaces within the System namespace such as System.Security, 
System.IO, System.Data, System.Collections etc.  
Reducing conflict is the greatest strength of namespaces. Class and method names often 
collide when using multiple libraries. This risk increases as programs get larger and 
include more third-party tools. 
Boxing Conversions
Boxing is the implicit conversion of a value type to a reference type or to any interface 
type implemented by this value type. This is possible due to the principle of type system 
unification where everything is an object. 
When boxing occurs, the contents of value type are copied from the stack into the 
memory allocated on the managed heap. The new reference type created contains a copy 
of the value type and can be used by other types that expect an object reference. The 
value contained in the value type and the created reference types are not associated in any 
way. If you change the original value type, the reference type is not affected. Boxing, 
thus, enables everything to appear to be an object, thereby avoiding the overhead required 
if everything actually were an object. 
Example:    
VB.NET 
Dim n as Integer = 10 
Dim obj as Object 
obj = n 
Explanation: 
In the above code segment, a value-type variable n is declared and is assigned the value 
10. The next statement declares an object-type variable obj. The last statement implicitly 
performs boxing operation on the variable n.  
UnBoxing Conversions
UnBoxing is the explicit conversion from a reference type to a value type or from an 
interface type to a value type that implements the interface. 
When unboxing occurs, memory is copied from the managed heap to the stack. For an 
unboxing conversion to a given value type to succeed at run time, the value of the source 
argument must be a reference to an object that was previously created by boxing a value 
of that value type otherwise an exception is thrown. 
VB.Net does not support the ability to explicitly unbox values. It relies on the helper 
functions in the Microsoft.VisualBasic.Helpers namespace to carry out unboxing. Since 
these helper functions are considerably less efficient than C# support for explicit 
unboxing. Thus it is recommended to avoid excessive use of variables of type Object. 
Boxing and UnBoxing have performance implications. Every time a value type is boxed, 
a new reference type is created and the value type is copied onto the managed heap. 
Depending on the size of the value type and the number of times value types are boxed 
and unboxed, the CLR can spend a lot of CPU cycles just doing these conversions. 
It is recommended to perform boxing and unboxing in a scenario where you have to pass 
a value parameter multiple times to a method that accepts a reference parameter. In such 
a case, it is advantageous to box the value parameter once before passing it multiple times 
to methods that accept reference methods. 
Enumerations
Enumerations are types that inherit from System.Enum. The elements of an enumeration 
are expressed in words rather than numbers, which makes it convenient for understanding 
the meaning of the value being used. Enumerations symbolically represent a set of values 
of one of the primitive integral types. 
The type of the elements of an enumeration can be Byte, Short, Integer or Long. If no 
type is specified explicitly, the default type is Integer.  
Example: 
Enum month As Byte 
Jan = 2 
Feb = 5 
Mar = 10 
End Enum 
Explanation: 
In the above code segment, an enumeration type month is declared. The underlying type 
of the elements has been specified as Byte. It has three elements viz: Jan, Feb and Mar. 
These three elements have been assigned specific values. In case of an enumeration, if no 
values are specified, the value of the first element corresponds to 0 and so on. 
Delegates
The runtime supports constructs called delegates, which enable late-bound operations 
such as method invocation and callback procedures. With delegates, a program can 
dynamically call different methods at runtime. They are type safe, secure, managed 
objects that always point to a valid object and cannot corrupt the memory of another 
object. The closest equivalent of a delegate in other languages is a function pointer, but 
whereas a function pointer can only reference Shared functions, a delegate can reference 
both Shared and instance methods. Delegates are Marshal by Value Objects.   
The members of a delegate are the members inherited from class System.Delegate.  
A delegate defines the signature and return type of a method. The resulting delegate can 
reference any method with a matching signature. Each instance of a delegate can forward 
a call to one or more methods that take those parameters and return the same type. Once a 
method has been assigned to a delegate, it is called when the delegate is invoked.  
Example: 
Module delegate_example 
Delegate Function calculation(ByVal a As Integer, ByVal b As Integer) As 
Integer 
Public Function add(ByVal num1 As Integer, ByVal num2 As Integer) As Integer 
add = num1 + num2 
 End Function 
 Sub Main() 
Dim calc_delegate As New calculation(AddressOf add) 
Dim result As Integer  
result = calc_delegate(50, 70) 
 End Sub 
End Module 
Explanation: 
Four steps are required to implement delegates viz. 
• Defining Delegates 
The foremost step is to define the delegate. The definition of the delegate specifies 
the method signature, return type of the method, access modifier and the delegate 
name. The method signature specifies the order and type of each argument.  
The definition of a delegate is indicated by the usage of the Delegate keyword. As 
shown in the above code segment, the delegate name is calculation, it's access 
modifier is public, it receives two integer arguments and returns an integer value.  
• Creating Delegate Method Handler(s) 
The next step is to define the method(s) that will be associated with the delegate. 
In the above code segment, a method named add is defined. This method must have  
same method signature as that of the delegate, as shown in the above code segment.  
• Hooking up Delegates and Method Handlers 
For a delegate method handler to be invoked, it must be assigned to a delegate object.  
In the above code, the delegate object is calc_delegate and is hooked up to the 
method handler add.   
• Invoking the method through the Delegate 
The last step is to invoke the methods that are associated with the delegate. A 
delegate method handler is invoked by making a method call on the delegate itself. 
This causes the method handler to invoke with the assigned input parameters as if 
they were invoked directly by the program, as shown in the above code.  
5.3 Features of VB.NET 
Option Explicit and Option Strict 
Option Explicit and Option Strict are compiler options that can be globally assigned to a 
project and are interpreted at compile time. Setting these options enables programmers to 
resolve some of the errors (e.g. typological errors) at compile time and thus prevent 
runtime errors. 
Option Explicit  
Option Explicit was a feature of VB 6.0 and it has been made a part of .NET environment 
too. This option can be used only at the module level. When this option is turned on, it 
forces explicit declaration of variables in that module. This option can be turned "On" or 
"Off". When it is not specified, by default, it is set to "Off". 
Syntax: Option Explicit [On / Off] 
When it is set to "On", it checks for any undeclared variables in the module at compile 
time. If any undeclared variable is found, it generates a compile time error since the 
compiler would not recognize the type of the undeclared variable. When it is set to "On", 
variables can be declared using Dim, Public, Private or ReDim statements. Setting this 
option to "On" helps programmers do away with any typological errors in the code.  
When it is set to "Off", all undeclared variables are considered to be of type Object. 
It is preferable to set this option to "On".  
Option Strict 
Visual Basic language in general does not require explicit syntax to be used when 
performing operations that might not be optimally efficient (e.g. late binding) or that 
might fail at run time (e.g. narrowing conversions). This permissive semantics often 
prevents detection of coding errors and also affects the performance of the application. 
VB.NET enables a programmer to enforce strict semantics by setting this option to "On". 
When used, this option should appear before any other code. This option can be set to 
"On" or "Off". If this statement is not specified, by default, it is set to "Off". 
Syntax:  Option Strict [On / Off] 
When it is set to "On", it disallows any narrowing conversions to occur without an 
explicit cast operator, late binding and does not let the programmer omit "As" clause in 
the declaration statement. Since setting it to "On" requires explicit conversion, it also 
requires that the compiler be able to determine the type of each variable. Thus it is 
implied that Option Strict also means Option Explicit.   
Visual Basic .NET allows implicit conversions of any data type to any other data type. 
However, data loss can occur if the value of one data type is converted to a data type with 
less precision or a smaller capacity. Setting this option to "On" ensures compile-time 
notification of these types of conversions so they may be avoided. 
Explicit conversions happen faster than the implicit conversions performed by the 
system. In case of implicit conversions, the system has to identify the types involved in 
the conversion and then obtain the correct handler to perform the conversion. In case of 
explicit conversions, processing time gets reduced since the type of conversion is 
explicitly mentioned. 
From programmer point of view, explicit conversion may seem to be a burden since it 
slows the development of a program by forcing the programmer to explicitly define each 
conversion that needs to occur. 
It is always recommended that you set Option Strict to "On" and use explicit conversions. 
ByVal is Default
When implementing functions/procedures we often need to pass information. This 
information can be passed to the called function/procedure through parameters. 
Parameters can be passed by value or by reference. 
When ByVal keyword is used, it causes the parameter to be passed by value. In this case, 
a copy of the original parameter is passed to the called module. Thus any changes made 
to the copy of the parameter do not affect the original value of the parameter. 
When ByRef  keyword is used, it sends a reference (pointer) to the original value to the 
called module rather than its copy. Thus any changes made to the parameter in the 
function/procedure will cause the original value to be modified.  
With ByRef you are exposing a variable to modification which can lead to an unexpected 
behavior. If that procedure calls another procedure and passes the same parameter ByRef, 
the chances of unintentionally changing the original variable are increased.  
In VB.NET, every parameter, by default, is passed by value if nothing is explicitly 
specified. Thus it protects arguments against modification.   
Example: 
Public Class SampleClass 
Sub Proc(ByVal a As Integer, b As Integer, ByRef c As Integer) 
a = a + 2 
b = b + 3 
c = c + 4 
 End Sub 
End Class 
Sub Main() 
Dim num1, num2, num3 As Integer 
Dim Obj As New SampleClass() 
num1 = 2 
num2 = 3 
num3 = 4 
Obj.Proc(num1, num2, num3) 
 System.Console.WriteLine(num1) 
 System.Console.WriteLine(num2) 
 System.Console.WriteLine(num3) 
End Sub 
Explanation: 
In the class SampleClass, there is one procedure Proc that takes three integers as 
arguments. In Main(), a variable of type SampleClass is defined and three other integer 
variables num1,num2,num3 are declared and given some initial values. The procedure is 
then called passing these three variables as arguments. First variable num1 is passed by 
value, second variable num2 is also passed by value since nothing is specified explicitly 
and the last variable num3 is passed by reference since it is explicitly mentioned. 
After calling the procedure, when the values of the three variables are checked, you will 
notice that num1 and num2 retain their original values since they are passed by value 
whereas the value of num3 changes to 8 since it was passed by reference.  
Sub and Functions with Parenthesis
In VB.NET, both functions and procedures require parentheses around the parameter list, 
even if it is empty. 
Example: 
Consider the following code that contains two functions and one procedure. The first 
function named "HelloWorld" accepts no argument and returns "Hello World". The 
second function named "HelloName" accepts an argument and appends that argument to 
the string "Hello World" and finally returns the appended string. The procedure named 
"Hello" displays the string "Hello World" on the console. 
Public Class SampleClass 
        Function HelloWorld( ) As String 
            Helloworld = "Hello  World" 
        End Function 
        Function HelloName(ByVal name As String) As String 
            HelloName = "Hello " & name 
        End Function 
        Sub Hello() 
            System.Console.WriteLine("Hello  World") 
        End Sub 
End Class 
Sub Main() 
     Dim Obj As New SampleClass() 
     Dim str1 As String 
     Dim str2 As String 
     str1 = Obj.HelloWorld() 
     str2 = Obj.HelloName(" Everybody") 
     Obj.Hello() 
End Sub 
Explanation: 
As mentioned, while calling the procedure Hello, parentheses have to be used even 
though it does not require any argument. Similar treatment has to done for functions. 
Structures Replace User Defined Types
In VB.NET, structures can be defined using Structure keyword. Unlike user defined 
types, structures share many features with classes. Explicit mention of access modifier for 
each member is necessary in VB.NET. Access modifiers can be Public, Protected, 
Friend, Protected Friend, or Private. You can also use the Dim statement, which 
defaults to public access.    
Let us take an example of a Person that will have some characteristics as Name, Address, 
Tel, Age etc. Now if we were to use this number of times, it will be better to have a type 
called Person. The example below shows how to handle this. 
Structure Person  
Structure Person        
Dim Name as String       
Private Address as String  
Dim Tel as String 
Public Age as Integer 
End Structure  
As shown in the above code, explicit mention of the access specifier for each member is a 
must. 
Structures, like classes, can contain data members as well as data methods. Structures are 
value types and are hence allocated on the stack where as classes are reference types and 
require heap allocation. 
Block Level Scope  
The scope of block level variables is restricted to the block in which they are defined. 
This block can be a function, procedure, a loop structure etc. A block level variable is not 
accessible anywhere, outside its block. 
Example: 
Consider the sample code segment. 
Sub BlockScope() 
Dim a As Integer = 1 
Dim i As Integer = 1 
While (i <= 2) 
Dim j As Integer = 1 
j = j + 1 
i = i + 1 
 End While 
a = a + j      
End Sub 
Explanation: 
The above code segment will give a compile-time error, since the scope of the variable ‘j’ 
is restricted to the while block and hence it is not accessible outside the while block. 
Though block level variables cannot be accessed outside their block, their lifetime is still 
that of the procedure containing them. 
Early Vs Late Binding 
In case of early binding, the compiler knows the object's data type at compile time and 
hence can directly compile code to invoke the methods on the object. This enables the 
compiler to discover the appropriate method and ensure that the referenced method does 
exist and the parameters provided are in sync with that of the referenced method. 
Since object types are known ahead of time, the IDE aids the programmer by providing 
support for IntelliSense. This helps the programmer do away with any typological and 
syntactical errors. If the method being referenced is not found, the programmer is notified 
at compile time thus letting him rectify it rather than making him wait till the application 
is run. 
In case of late binding, the compiler cannot determine the object's data type and thus the 
code interacts with the object dynamically at runtime. To make an object late-bound, it is 
defined as a variable of type Object. This variable can reference any type of object and 
allows programmers to attempt arbitrary method calls against the object even though the 
Object datatype does not implement those methods. Since type of the object is not 
known until runtime, neither compile-time syntax checking nor IntelliSense is possible. 
The typological errors also go undetected until the application is run. However, there is 
an unprecedented flexibility, since code that makes use of late binding can talk to any 
object from any class as long as those objects implement the methods we require.   
The discovery of the referenced method is done dynamically done at runtime and is then 
invoked. This discovery takes time and the mechanism used to invoke a method through 
late binding is not as efficient as that used to call a method that is known at compile time.     
Thus, though late binding is flexible, it is error-prone and slower as compared to early 
binding. 
When Option Strict is "On", it does not support late binding since the datatype of the 
object should be known at compile time.   
Example: 
Consider the below given code segment 
Public Class SampleClass 
    Public Sub Proc() 
        MessageBox("This method is discovered dynamically at runtime") 
    End Sub 
End Class 
Public Class MainClass 
   Shared Sub Main() 
      Dim Obj As Object 
      Obj = New SampleClass() 
      Obj.Proc() 
   End Sub 
End Class 
Explanation: 
The above code segment implements late-binding. There are two classes viz. 
SampleClass and MainClass. The class SampleClass contains a procedure named Proc 
that takes no arguments. This procedure displays an appropriate message in a message 
box. The class MainClass declares a variable Obj of type Object. Thus at compile-time, 
the actual data type of the variable is not known. At runtime, the system finds that it is 
referencing a variable of type Sampleclass. This reference to the class is achieved using 
new operator. The referenced method Proc is discovered at runtime and is finally 
invoked.  
Ctype Function   
Ctype is a general cast keyword that coerces an expression into any type. It returns the 
result of explicitly converting an expression to a specified data type, object, structure, 
class, or interface. If no conversion exists from the type of the expression to the specified 
type, a compile-time error occurs. When Ctype is used to perform explicit conversion, 
execution is faster since it is compiled inline and hence no call to a procedure is involved 
to perform the conversion. 
Syntax: Ctype (expression, type name) 
Example: 
Consider the below given code segment  
Public Class TrialClass 
   Sub Proc (obj as Object) 
      Dim Obj1 As OtherClass( )  
Obj1 =  Ctype (obj, OtherClass) 
      Obj1.OtherProc( ) 
   End Sub 
End Class 
Explanation: 
The variable Obj1 is of type OtherClass. This class has a procedure named OtherProc. 
In the above code segment, the procedure Proc takes one parameter of type Object. The 
Ctype statement gains an early bound reference to the object of type OtherClass. Thus 
performance benefits of early binding can be achieved. 
Changes to Boolean Operators
In Visual Basic.NET, And, Or, Xor, and Not are the boolean operators and BitAnd, 
BitOr, BitXor, and BitNot are used for bitwise operations.   
VB.NET has introduced the concept of short-circuiting. According to this concept, if the 
first operand of an And operator evaluates to False, the remainder of the logical 
expression is not evaluated. Similarly, if the first operand of an Or operator evaluates to 
True, the remainder of the logical expression is not evaluated.  
To perform the above mentioned functionality, VB.NET has introduced two new 
operators viz. AndAlso and OrElse. AndAlso performs short-circuiting logical 
conjunction on two expressions whereas OrElse performs short-circuiting logical 
disjunction on two expressions 
Syntax : expression1 AndAlso expression2 
  expression1 OrElse expression2 
Structured Error Handling     
The whole idea behind error handling is to accurately trap the error. VB.NET has 
introduced a structured approach for handling errors, in order to keep in sync with the 
features offered by all Object Oriented languages viz. C#, Java etc. This structured 
approach is implemented using a Try…Catch…Finally block structure and is known as 
Exception Handling.  
Try statement comes before the block of code that needs to tested for errors, Catch 
statement handles specific errors and hence surrounds the block of code that handles 
those errors and Finally block of code is always executed and contains cleanup routines 
for exception situations. Since Catch block is specific to the type of error that needs to be 
caught, a single Try statement can have multiple Catch blocks associated with it. 
Example: 
Consider the below given code segment 
Dim num1 As Integer 
Dim num2 As Integer 
Dim num3 As Integer 
Dim str As String 
num1 = CType(System.Console.ReadLine( ), Integer) 
num2 = CType(System.Console.ReadLine( ), Integer) 
str = System.Console.ReadLine( ) 
Try 
    num3 = num1 / num2 
    num1 = CType(str, Integer) 
Catch e1 As System.InvalidCastException 
 System.Console.WriteLine("There is a casting error") 
Catch e2 As System.OverflowException 
 System.Console.WriteLine("There is an overflow error") 
Finally 
     System.Console.Writeline("Please enter valid input") 
End Try 
Explanation:  
The above code segment has been written with an intention of creating an error to explain 
the structured way of trapping errors. As shown, it accepts two integers and one string 
from the user and tries to divide first number by the second number and also tries to 
convert the entered string to an integer. Since the statements that divide the numbers and 
perform casting are critical, they are put in the Try…Catch…Finally block structure.  
The code segment has two Catch statements viz. first statement handles the casting 
(wrong format) error while the second one handles the overflow (division) error.  
If the user will enter zero as the second number, then the code will throw an overflow 
exception which will be handled by displaying the error message on the Console. 
Similarly, if the user will enter a string say "Hello" as the third argument, the code will 
throw an invalidcast exception which will be handled by displaying the error message on 
the Console. In both the cases, the Finally block of code is always executed. Finally 
block is even executed, when there is no error in the program. Thus it is the right place to 
perform cleanup routines. 
This structured approach provided by VB.NET lets the programmer track the precise 
location of the error in the code.  
Data Type Changes

A Boolean variable can be assigned one of the two states viz. True or False.   
In VB.NET, when numeric types are converted to Boolean values, 0 becomes False and 
all other values become True.  
When Boolean values are converted to Integer values, True maps to -1 and False maps 
to 0. 
String  
To be inline with other .NET languages, VB.NET has updated string length declaration.  
In VB.NET, you cannot declare a string to have a fixed length. You must declare the 
string without a length. When a value gets assigned to the string, the length of the value 
determines the length of the string.  
5.4 Control Statements  
VB.Net has statements such as If .. Then ..else and Select …. Case, which help you to 
conditionally execute program. 
VB.Net provides you with various looping statements, such as Do… Loop, While…. End 
While, and For… Next. 
1. The If….Then….Else…End if Statement 
Consider a student marks and grade evaluation. For Marks above 75 the grade is ‘A’ and 
for below 75 is ‘B’. In this situation when you need to execute some code based on some 
condition, you can make use of, If…then…else…end if. 
The Cultural syntax normally used is as follows: 
If condition Then 
Executable statements when the condition is True 
Else 
Executable statements when the Condition is False 
End If 
OR using Elseif for Advanced Decision making  
If condition Then 
Executable statements 
ElseIf condition Then  
Executable statements 
End If 
Single if can have multiple else with conditions, as mentioned above in elseif format and 
finally a single End If for the main If condition. 
Nesting IF…Then Constructs 
If condition Then 
If condition2 Then 
Executable statements when the condition2 is TRUE 
 Else 
  End if 
Else 
  Executable Statements 
Executable statements 
End If 
One important thing to keep in mind when nesting IF…Then constructs is that you must have corresponding End If statement for 
every IF ..Then statement, unless the If then statement executes only one statement and that statement appears on the same line as 
If…Then 
2. The Select…Case Statement(Evaluating an Expression for Multiple Values) 
The Select…Case Statement is similar to If…Else…End if. The only difference between 
two is that If and elseif can evaluate different expressions in each statement, but the 
Select statement can evaluate only one expression. 
The drawback of  IF...Then construct is that it  isn’t capable of handling a decision 
situation without a lot of extra work. One such situation is when you have to perform 
different actions based on numerous possible values of an expression, not just True or 
False. For instance performing actions based on Students Marks. 
If  intmarks  >35 Then  
……. 
Elseif intmarks >50 then  
…… 
Elseif intmarks>65 then  
…..  
Elseif intmarks>75 then  
… 
Else 
End If 
…. 
As you see the structure can be a bit hard to read and if the conditions increase you may 
end up writing a confusing and an unreadable piece of Code 
The Select uses the result of an expression to execute different set of statements. 
The syntax for the Select…Case Statement is as follows: 
Select Case [expression] 
Case [expression list] 
   Executable statements. 
Case Else  
Executable statements. 
Exit Select  - to exit from the select 
End Select 
Note: Case Else is used to define the code that executes only when the expression doesn’t 
evaluate to any of the values in Case Statements .Use of Case Else is optional 
Lets see the same example as above but this time with Select Case  
Select Case intmarks 
Case Is >35  
      Executable statements 
Case Is >50 
      Executable statements 
Case Is>65 
      Executable statements 
Case Is >75 
      Executable statements 
Case Else 
            Executable statements 
End Select 
Evaluating More than one possible Value in a Case Statement 
Select Case helps you to use some more advanced expression comparisons. Like,you can 
specify multiple comparisons in a Single Case statement by just using comma. Lets see 
how it does 
Select Case strColor 
Case Is=”Red”,”Blue”,”Magenta” 
‘Color is a Dark Shade  
Case Is =”Cream”,”white”  
‘Color is a Cool Shade 
End Select 
Another comparison expression used is keyword To, Visual Basic.NET evaluates the 
expression and finds out whether it is in the range mentioned and if yes the Statement is 
executed. Please note that when using To, you can’t include Is = as you can with the 
simple expression 
Select Case intmarks 
Case 1 to 35  
 ‘Executable statements 
Case 36 to 50 
 ‘Executable Statements 
End Select 
3. For…Next Statement 
The For…Next Statements are used repeat a set of statements for specific number of 
times. 
 The syntax for the For…Next Statements is as follows: 
For counter = <start value> to <end value> [Step Value] 
Executable Statements 
Exit For 
Next [counter]  
Counter is any numeric value. 
Start value is the initial value of the counter. 
End value is the final value of the counter. 
Step Value is the value by which the counter is incremented. It can be positive or 
negative. The default value is 1. 
Exit For is used to exit the For…Next loop at any time. When  Exit for is encountered 
,the execution jumps to the statement following Next 
Next is the statement the marks the end of the For statement. As soon as the program 
encounters the Next statement, the step value is added to the counter and the next 
iteration of the loop takes place. 
Dim intctr as Integer 
For intctr=1 to 100  
Debug.WriteLine(intctr) 
Next intctr 
This routine starts a loop with a For statement after a variable intctr is declared. This loop 
initializes intctr to 1 and then prints 1 through 100 to the output window. It prints in steps 
of 1 as Step has been omitted here, so the default is 1 
Example of use of STEP in For....Loop. 
Let us write a table of 2 using step in for loop. 
Add a label with name it as lbtables and make it bit bigger on the screen. 
Dim j = 1 
For i = 2 To 20 Step 2 
Me.lbtables.Text = Me.lbtables.Text & "2 X " & j.ToString & " = " &  
                    i.ToString & vbCrLf 
j = j + 1 
Next 
Output: 
2 X 1 = 2 
.. 
.. 
.. 
.. 
.. 
… 
2 X 10 = 20 
An Example of Nested For loop. 
Let us write a small code to display a structure of stars ‘*’ in triangle format. 
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * * 
Let us have a label with name stars. Increase the height of the label to get a clear view of 
the image. 
Dim star As String 
Dim i, j As Integer 
For i = 0 To 5 ' First loop to count the rows 
   For j = 0 To i ' Second loop to count the columns 
      star = star & " * " 
   Next 
Me.stars.Text = Me.stars.Text & star & vbCrLf ' To print * 
star = "" 
Next 
4. For Each…Next Statement 
The For Each…Next Statement is used to repeat a set of statements for each element in 
an array or collection. 
The For Each…Next statement is executed if there is at least one item in an array of 
collection. 
The Loop repeats of each element in an array or collection. 
The syntax for the For Each…Next statement as follows: 
For Each  Component In Set 
Executable statements 
Next 
Component is the variable used to refer to the elements of an array or a collection. 
Set refers to an array or any collection object. e.g. 
Dim weeks() As String = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",_ 
                         "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"} 
        Dim eachday As String 
        For Each eachday In weeks 
            MsgBox(eachday) 
        Next 
An example for using for each element in a collection of string into a single string 
element.  
Each element of array which is of type string is read from the collection and stored into 
the single string type object. 
5. While…End Statement 
The While…End Statement is used to repeat set of executable statements as long as the 
condition is true. 
 The syntax for the While…End statement is as follows: 
While Condition  
Executable Statements 
End While 
In this if the condition is satisfied then the statements are executed. Else it will not 
enter the While condition at all.  
6. Do...Loop Statement 
The Do…Loop Statement is similar to While…End. Here we have two types of 
formatting the loop. 
a) Do While / Until Condition Executable Statements Loop 
b) Do Executable Statements Loop While/Until Condition 
The Difference is in a) The loop will be executed if the condition is satisfied, but in b)  
The Loop will be executed at least once even if the condition does not satisfy. 
Do While Expression 
 [Statements] 
Loop 
Do Until Expression 
[Statements] 
Loop 
Note: For VB programmers While Wend is not supported it is While… End now 
 
A Complete Example with set of control statements. 
We will create a VB.Net application, which will accept students name and its grade. 
Depending up the type of grade it will add remarks. 
 
 
   txtsummary.Text = "" 
 
        Dim value, ctr As Integer 
 
        'Accept a number from the user 
        value = CInt(InputBox("Enter the number of students")) 
 
        'Check if the validity of the number 
        If value <= 0 Then 
            MsgBox("Enter details of at least one student", "Error") 
        End If 
 
        Dim arrName(value) As String 
        Dim sGrade As String 
        Dim arrRemarks(value) As String 
 
        While ctr < value 
 
            'Accept the name of the students 
         arrName(ctr) = InputBox("Enter the name of the Student"_ 
& ctr + 1, "Enter Details") 
            'Accept the grade of the Student 
         sGrade = InputBox("Enter the grade of the student" & 
"(_A/B/C/D/F)", "Grade Details") 
 
            ' Assign remarks to  students 
            Select Case UCase(sGrade) 
                Case "A" 
                    arrRemarks(ctr) = "Excellent" 
                Case "B" 
                    arrRemarks(ctr) = "Good" 
                Case "C" 
                    arrRemarks(ctr) = "Fair" 
                Case "D" 
                    arrRemarks(ctr) = "Poor" 
                Case "F" 
                    arrRemarks(ctr) = "Fail" 
                Case Else 
                    MsgBox("Incorrect value entered ", _ 
MsgBoxStyle.Critical) 
                    Exit Sub ' To come out of the program 
            End Select 
            ctr = ctr + 1 
        End While 
        ' Display the summary in the text box 
        For ctr = 0 To value - 1 
           If txtsummary.Text = "" Then 
                If LCase(arrRemarks(ctr)) = "fail" Then 
txtsummary.Text = arrName(ctr) & " has failed _ 
    in 
exams" & vbCrLf 
                Else 
             txtsummary.Text = arrName(ctr) & "'s performance is_ 
" & arrRemarks(ctr) & vbCrLf 
                End If 
           Else 
                If LCase(arrRemarks(ctr)) = "fail" Then 
                    txtsummary.Text = txtsummary.Text & arrName(ctr) &_  
" has failed in exams" & vbCrLf 
                Else 
                    txtsummary.Text = txtsummary.Text & arrName(ctr) &_  
"'s performance is " & arrRemarks(ctr) &_ vbCrLf 
                End If 
            End If 
        Next 
5.5 Arrays 
Till now we have been using variable to store values. We might come across a situation 
when we might need to store multiple values of similar type. Such as names of 100 
students in a school. One way to do it is to declare 100 variables and store all the names. 
A much more simple and efficient way of storing these variable is using Arrays. An 
Array is a memory location that is used to store multiple values. 
All the values in an array are of the same type, such as Integer or String and are 
referenced by their index or subscript number, which is the order in which these values 
are stored in the array. These values are called the elements of the array. 
The number of elements that an array contains is called the length of the array. 
In VB.Net all arrays are inherited from the System.Array Class. 
Arrays can be single or multidimensional. You can determine the dimensions of an array 
by the number of subscripts that are used to identify the position of any array element. 
A single dimensional array is identified by only a single subscript and an element in a 
two-dimensional array is identified by two subscripts. 
The dimension has to be declared before using them in a program. The array declaration 
comprises the name of the array and the number of elements the array can contain. 
The Syntax of single dimension array is as follows. 
Dim ArrayName  (number of elements) as Element Data type. 
e.g.  
Dim studentname(10) as string  
Or 
Dim studentname() as string = new string(10) 
You can assign the values at runtime or even at the design time. 
Design time declaration: 
Studentname(0)=”Rohan”  
Studentname(1)=”Mohan” 
….. 
Studentname(10)=”Nitin” 
All arrays starts with the index of 0 i.e. All arrays are Zero Based and there is no 
provision of an option Base Statement where in you can specify the Lower Bound . This 
implies that above array can store 11 elements. Here 0, is the starting index or the lower 
bound of the array. The lower bound is fixed for all the arrays. 
Example 1. 
We will create a VB.Net application that will accept the names of students in an single 
dimension array and display it back. 
Add a textbox and set the name property to txtnames. Set the multilane property of the 
text box to true. 
Put a button and write the following in the onclick event. 
txtnames.Text = "" 
Dim value, count As Integer 
'Accept how many students names to enter 
value = CInt(InputBox("Enter the number of students name to enter:")) 
Dim arrnames(value) As String 
Dim cnt As Integer 
For cnt = 0 To value 
arrnames(cnt) = InputBox("Enter the name of student " & cnt + 1 & ":", 
"Student Name") 
Next 
'Display the entered value to the text box 
For cnt = 0 To value  
    If txtnames.Text = "" Then 
         txtnames.Text = arrnames(cnt) & vbCrLf ' for carriage returns 
    Else 
         txtnames.Text = txtnames.Text & arrnames(cnt) & vbCrLf 
    End If 
Next 
Above example will accept number of names to be entered and will add the names in a 
loop and then redisplay it in a text box. 
The Syntax for multi-dimension arrays is as follows: 
Previously we saw how we can store multiple names of students. But, if we want to store 
related data of students like first name, middle name, last name. In such situations you 
can use multi dimension arrays, such as two-or-three dimension arrays. 
Dim ArrayName (number of 1st element, number of 2nd element,….) as element data 
type. 
Or  
Simpler form would be    
Dim ArrayName( number of rows, number of columns) as element data type of two 
dimension. 
e.g. 
Dim studentdetails(10,2) as string 
Index positions  of array elements. 
0,0 0,1 
1,0 1,1 
2,0 2,1 
3,0 3,1 
…  
10,0 10,1 
studentdetails(0,0) = “Manoj”  
studentdetails(0,1) = “Malik” 
 
To display “Malik” we need to use the index position of the array and say , 
 
Studentdetails(0,1). 
 
Example 2. 
 
We will create a VB.Net  application, which will accept Student Name, Address and city 
name and display it in the text box in a formatted way. 
 
 
 
 
As in the earlier example we will create a text box , change its name and its multi line 
property to true. 
 
Change the text box to txtsummary. 
Add a button and write the below code in that. 
 
Dim arrsummary(3, 3) As String 
Dim i, j As Integer 
 
'As we wanted just 3 columns we have set it to 2, else if u want to be 
two only then while declaring the array make it (2,2) as the lower 
index is 0. 
 
For i = 0 To 2  
  For j = 0 To 2  
 arrsummary(i, j) = InputBox("Enter the value for " & i & " row _ 
                           and " & j & " column ", "Summary") 
   Next 
Next 
 
 
 
 
'Display the values in the summary array. 
 
  For i = 0 To 2 
      For j = 0 To 2 
          If txtsummary.Text = "" Then 
             txtsummary.Text = arrsummary(i, j) 
          Else 
            txtsummary.Text = txtsummary.Text & "-" & arrsummary(i, j) 
          End If 
       Next 
       txtsummary.Text = txtsummary.Text & vbCrLf 
  Next

Dynamic Arrays. 
Till now what we read were about fixed arrays. Let us see how we can manipulate the 
size of an array at run time. 
Many times we feel that the size of array in not enough or too much then required. As we 
know that array will allocate memory location when its declared, so to release or add 
more we need to change the dimension of the array which has been pre-declared. 
We can  create a dynamic array by not specifying the size of the array at the time of array 
declaration. 
Syntax: 
Dim student_names() as string 
In the above syntax you will see that number of elements are not mentioned. Now to re
declare the elements we make use of ReDim for an array to change its dimension. 
e.g. 
Dim student_names() as string 
ReDim student_names(10) 
ReDim can also change the size of multi-dimensional arrays. 
You can change the number of dimensions in an array, but you cannot make a multi
dimensional array to a  single dimension or lesser than the original dimension. 
e.g.  
Dim student_details(10,15) as string 'Declaring the array 
ReDim student_details(10,25) 'Resizing the array 
This statement does not change the data type of the array element or initialize the new 
values for the array elements. 
This statement can be used at the procedure level only not at the class level or module 
level. 
ReDim statements reinitializes the value of arrays with the respective data type  declared  
by the array.  
If u have initialized  the array to a some values it will be lost during the time of resizing 
and the default values will be restored in those elements. 
E.g.  
'Declaring the array and initializing the value for the array 
dim students_names() as string = {“Rahul”}  
'This will display the value Rahul 
msgbox(students_names(0))  
Now resizing the array. 
ReDim students_names(10)  
'This will give a fixed size to 10 elements 
msgbox(students_names(0))  
This will display a blank value, as during the resizing the values of the array are 
reinitialized to default value of string which is blank. 
Now to avoid such problems we will make use of a keyword called Preserve while 
resizing the array to new value. 
Using the above example , we will make changes in the declaration. 
ReDim students_names(10) 'The old declaration 
ReDim Preserve students_names(10)  
Students_names(1) = “Alex” 
Students_names(2) = “Michael” 
Msgbox(students_names(0))  
This will display the value as ‘Rahul’ which we had initialized before resizing it. So 
Preserve will restore all the initialized value of elements declared in an array. 
If the array is an two or more dimensional array , you can only change the size of the last 
dimension by using preserve keyword. 
Dim student_details(10,20) as string 
ReDim preserve student_details(15,25)  
This will raise error because we are trying to change the first dimension also. So u can 
only change the last dimension in case of multi-dimensional array. 
Few Important methods in arrays. 
Ubound() and Lbound(). 
Ubound is to get the upper limit of an array. 
Lbound is to get the lower limit of an array by default lower limit is 0. 
e.g. 
Dim weeks() As String = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",  
                         "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"} 
Dim upper As Integer 
Dim lower As Integer 
upper = UBound(weeks) 
lower = LBound(weeks) 
MsgBox(upper.ToString & " - " & lower.ToString) 
You will get 6 – 0 as the answer. 
If you count the number of elements initialized elements its seven, but all arrays starts 
with lower bound as 0. So from 0 – 6 is equal to 7 elements. 
This works for single dimension , but for multi-dimensions,  
We make use of the following: 
Getupperbound(), getlowerbound() these functions are methods of the array class. 
You can use it with single dimension also but best for multi-dimensional arrays. 
Syntax : arrayname.getupperbound/getlowerbound(dimension) 
Dimension  refers to the which upper/lower bound should be found, 0 for first, 1 for 
second and so on. 
example. 
Dim student_details(10,20,15) 
Dim upperlimit as integer 
upperlimit = student_details.getupperbound(0)  
' This will return 10 for the 1st row element 
upperlimit = student_details.getupperbound(1)  
' This will return 20 for the 2nd row of element 
For all getlowerbound(dimension) it will return 0 as the base lower bound is zero in .NET

There are various approaches to solve a problem. Moreover, these approaches 
are to a great extent dependant upon how each one of us tries to analyze and 
solve the problem.  
We have a very simple assignment: 
Lets say we want to calculate a distance formula for traveling from one place to 
another. The distance formula has to include all the attributes of the journey. So 
let us see what data do we have- 
Variables: 
Location: Have to go from one city to another (both the cities can be anywhere 
in the world). 
Modes of travel: Car/Bus/Train 
Date constraints: Departure/Arrival Date.  
Time Preference: Morning/Afternoon /Evening 
Distance: Break Journey  
Travel Cost. Etc 
Now, we have termed these data items as “variables” because their value would 
be changing based upon the various choices made. 
Even for such a trivial problem, there are being so many options/constraints, 
there are so many approaches to arrive at a decision. On similar lines, given a 
problem and basic resources (which also act as constraints), various 
algorithms can do the task programmatically. An algorithm is nothing but the 
thought process/approach involved.  
A good approach should   
• Be generic so that it works well with all possible combinations of inputs.  
• Flexible / adaptable to absorb new inputs. (New destination, routes, rates, 
timings or even new mode of travel - say space travel)  
• Give solutions in the desired timeframe.  
• Make best use of resources available. (Optimize the solution)  
• Cost effective.  
• Simple enough. 
Primitively, there was a very straightforward manner to write applications. 
Straightforward in the sense that the various tasks in the application would be 
identified and would be automated. This approach did work for many scenarios 
but when it came to the robustness or maintenance of the application, this 
approach proved to be insufficient. 
In this section we will first discuss what was the procedural approach and how 
the design of an application be made using this approach. By trying to figure out 
the negative points in the approach we will then appreciate the advantages of 
object oriented programming by discussing it as a solution to overcome the 
shortcomings of procedural programming. 
6.1 Concept of Procedural Programming 
The whole core of procedural programming lies in deriving a straightforward 
sequential step-by-step guide to do a particular task. Let us understand this by 
analyzing a case study. 
Lets take up a classic Payroll application that deals with various types of 
specifications for different employees. Lets say that this application is developed 
in one of the best procedural languages – C.  
So, the “Employee” in the application will be represented by a structure, which 
will contain all the Employee attributes as data members of the structure. 
Assume that the application deals with three types of employees – Clerk, 
Manager and Marketing executive. All the employees do have some common 
attributes and certain specific allowances (lets not talk of deductions!). The clerk 
gets medical allowance, the executive gets the traveling allowance and the 
manager gets house rent allowance and dearness allowance. Our Employee 
structure might look something like this: 
struct Employee  
{ 
 int  Id; 
 char Name[25]; 
 char *Address; 
 char Designation[20]; 
 double Basic; 
 float Med_Allow; 
 float Tra_Allow; 
 float HRA; 
 float DA; 
} 
The application would have functions, which would act upon the data, and do the 
necessary functionalities. So there would be at least following functions apart 
from others: 
void AddDetails() ;   
  // To add details of the  
//  
employee to the structure 
void PrintDetails() ;    // To print the details of a  
 // 
 particular Employee 
double CalcSalary();   // To calculate the salary of a 
  // employee 
This also could have been done having three different structures one for each 
Employee type but this would increase the overhead in programming in the 
functions and there would be a requirement of declaring three different arrays; 
one to store all clerk variables, one for manager variables and one for executive. 
So let us have a common structure, which would suite all the employee types. 
If we try to figure out the central algorithm of every function it would be quite 
monotonous wherein every function would have a strict type inspection routine to 
check the type of Employee every time. Because the functionalities differ for 
every type of Employee. 
void CalcSalary () 
{ 
 switch(EMP_TYPE) 
 { 
  case CLERK: 
// All the CLERK specific calculations 
  case MANAGER: 
// All the MANAGER specific calculations 
  case EXECUTIVE: 
// All the EXECUTIVE specific calculations 
} 
} 
This kind of type inspection will be featuring in every function, which would be 
dependant upon the type of the Employee. 
Now, if we have to add a new Employee type to this application, which has its 
own specification about, the allowances received try to figure out the changes 
that we will have to do in the current case study. Not only will the Employee 
structure have to be modified but also even the functions have to be changed in 
order to accommodate the new Employee type. So just as we are currently 
having a case statement to correspond to one employee type, we will have to 
introduce one more case statement corresponding to the new employee type. In 
addition, while calculating the salary we might introduce some local variables in 
the function to do the necessary calculations. There is a probability that the new 
additions may lead to certain bugs being introduced in the current “working” 
code. So let us list down the various problems we would face in this application: 
Maintenance: -- If the application has to support some change in the existing 
business logic for a particular employee type there might be more problems 
introduced since it is the same function that would be called for the different 
employee types. 
Enhancement: -- When the application has to be enhanced further to add a new 
type of employee there would be changes made in all the functions, which 
depend upon the type of employee. Hence enhancing an application further 
would be quite hectic. Why only new type of employee? Even if have to add a 
little more functionality to an existing function it would prove quite cryptic. 
Extensibility: -- The current design of the application does not allow us to have 
extensibility easily. Therefore, if we have to add more functions, which would do 
certain tasks for all the employee types or maybe for some of the type of 
employees; the new function also will have a strict type inspection routine to 
check for the type of employee. 
Storage: -- A small but significant problem. Whenever we have the data saved in 
a persistent storage i.e. having the data into files on the hard disk we will have to 
take care of saving the data along with the appropriate type of the employee. 
Also, while reading the data from the file its necessary to read the type first and 
then accordingly initialize the members in the structure.  
If we try to look for the core problem in the application design which can be 
qualified as a cause for all the problems discussed above it definitely would be 
an attempt to design a common algorithm to suit all the types of employees. It 
would definitely prove helpful if rather than concentrating on the procedures we 
concentrate more upon the entities in the application. 
6.2 Object Oriented Programming 
Now with the major shortcomings of procedural programming let us look at how a 
different approach would help us. As mentioned earlier it is necessary to 
concentrate more upon the entities in the application and not only upon the tasks 
done by the application. 
Based upon this bottom line we have a certain set of rules defined as object- 
oriented paradigm. If a programming language satisfies these rules i.e. provides 
certain features or keywords to implement these rules it would be qualified as an 
object oriented programming language.  
Lets discuss the major conventions for object-oriented programming. 
6.3 Classes  
One of the major problems in the earlier approach was also the data and the 
functions working upon the data being separate. This leads to the necessity of 
checking the type of data before operating upon the data. The first rule of the 
object-oriented paradigm says that if the data and the functions acting upon the 
data can go together let them be together. We can define this unit, which 
contains the data and its functions together as a class. A class can also be 
defined as a programmatic representation of an entity and the behavior of that 
entity can be represented by the functions in the class. In our earlier case study 
the employee, can be represented as a class. A class will contain its data into 
various variables, which would be termed as data members and the behavior of 
the class, which will be encapsulated, as functions will be termed as member 
functions. 
6.4 Encapsulation 
Many a times when we use certain tools, we hardly pay attention to the details 
about the functionality of the tool. We hardly pay attention to the various other 
units, which make up the tool. This behavior to ignore unwanted details of an 
entity is termed as abstraction.  
Now if the details are unwanted why show them to the user? Therefore, the 
creator might attempt to hide these unwanted details. This behavior is termed as 
encapsulation. So we can say that encapsulation is an implementation of 
abstraction. Encapsulation directly leads to two main advantages: 
Data Hiding: -- The user of the class does not come to know about the internals 
of the class. Hence, the user never comes to know about the exact data 
members in the class. The user interacts with the data members only through the 
various member functions provided by the class. 
Data Security: - Since the data, members are not directly available to the user 
directly but are available only through the member functions a validity check can 
always be imposed to ensure that only valid data is been inserted into the class. 
So a Date class, which contains individual data members for storing date, month 
and year, will have it ensured the month is never 13 or the date is never 
exceeding 31. 
6.5 Inheritance 
What is common between a father and a son? At least one thing would be 
common – their assets! 
In real life, inheritance allows us to reuse things that belong to a particular entity. 
Also, in object oriented world a class can inherit the properties and functionalities 
defined in some another class so that they can be reused. Then we have to be a 
bit careful in designing these classes because reusability cannot be done unless 
the classes are of the same type. So the class which would be reusing the 
functionalities of the other class in object oriented terms we would say that the 
class is “deriving” from the former class and is termed as the derived class. The 
class that is being “derived from” is termed as the base class. Inheritance 
directly results in the following benefits: -- 
Reusability: -- Inheritance results in functionalities defined in one class being 
reused in the derived classes. So the efforts of rewriting the same functionality 
for every derived class is being saved. This definitely saves a lot of development 
time. 
Enhancement and Specification: -- Due to the characteristic of inheritance, we 
can club the common functionalities in the base class and have the specific 
functionalities in the derived class. This feature can be used to have a 
functionality defined in the base class to be further modified for betterment or 
specification by the derived class. This mechanism of redefining the functionality 
of the base class in the derived class is termed as “overriding” 
Avoiding type inspection:--  In the case study that we discussed to understand 
procedural approach we had a strict type inspection routine at the library end 
wherein in every function in the library we had to check for the type of the 
employee for whom the work has to be done. With inheritance, we would have a 
common base class called as “Employee” which would have all the common 
functionalities defined where as the specific routines do be done for various types 
of employees would go in the respective derived classes. So there would be 
class defined for every type of employee and the class would all the 
specifications for that type of employee and would be derived from the base 
class Employee to inherit the common functionalities. Therefore, in the functions 
now we wont have to check for the type of employee every time because every 
employee type has its own specific routines defined within it. 
6.6 Polymorphism 
The word “polymorphism” means “different forms”. Applied in object-oriented 
paradigm it means the ability of an entity to exhibit different forms at runtime. 
However, why would such a kind of feature be required? One major reason to 
have this is to eliminate the type inspection. As we can see in the earlier case 
study that we discussed there would also be a type inspection checking at the 
client application level where in the employee entities would be used.  So just as 
in every functionality, we had checked for the type of employee we will also have 
to check in the main function about the type of employee we are handling. With 
polymorphism, we can have this level of type inspection also being eradicated 
totally. 
Mapping the procedural approach to an object oriented scenario 
// Common functionality for all types 
of  
// Employees 
switch ( EMPLOYEE TYPE) 
{ 
 case CLERK: 
 // specific functionalities   
 // for a clerk 
 case MANAGER: 
 // specific functionalities for 
 // a manager 
case EXECUTIVE: 
 // specific functionalities for 
 // a executive 
} 
Base Members
Base Class 
Derived Classes
Class Employee 
{ 
 // Common      
  // Functionalities 
} 
Class Clerk {
} 
Overrided Members 
Class 
Manager { 
} 
Class 
Executive  { 
} 
How does .NET support object oriented programming? 
As we have discussed in the earlier sections .NET happens a to be a “complete 
framework”. The basic approach adopted by the framework is object-oriented 
and the framework would support only object-oriented code. So no more C and 
COBOL applications! Although C++ and OO-COBOL would work perfectly fine. 
Since the framework is inherently object-oriented everything i.e. every data type 
in the framework will be a class. Unlike C++, even the primitive data types will be 
given by the framework as a set of classes. 
The framework also provides us with a rich set of classes which can be used by 
instantiating them or writing new classes by deriving from the framework classes. 
The framework does have a systematic organization of classes wherein the 
Object class from the System namespace (we will discuss namespaces in details 
later) tops the chart. All the other classes are derived from the Object class.  
Component Oriented Programming 
However, is it really enough just to have an object oriented approach? Well, now 
with the increasing influence of the web and code reusability getting extended 
across the language barriers its very much essential to even extend “Object 
Oriented approach “ itself. 
We need to extend the definition of the “class” which happens to be the basic 
element of object oriented programming. We know that the class serves as an 
abstraction or simulation of a real life entity. However, in order to have a total 
encapsulation the internals of the class has to be totally hidden. Secondly, the 
class should be instantiable across various programming languages to have a 
more range of reusability. The class should ideally support properties (will be 
discussed a little later) to offer more user friendliness and overcoming the 
incompatibilities. 
Therefore, a class must have the following extra abilities in addition to what it 
serves in object-oriented scenario: 
• Encapsulated data and implementations 
• Properties 
• Language Interoperable 
We can term instance of such a class as a “component”. VB.NET and CSharp 
happen to be component- oriented languages in a way that every class created 
in any of these languages when instantiated results in a component. 
6.7 Understanding CSharp and VB.NET as Object Oriented 
Programming languages 
After knowing the object-oriented concepts let us examine how these concepts 
can be implemented in CSharp (C#) or VB.NET. These two languages are been 
introduced along with the .NET framework and are totally .NET compliant. So 
VB.NET will be a natural upgrade for VB programmers and CSharp for C++ 
programmers. We will be looking at the various syntaxes of both these languages 
to implement object oriented programming. 
Classes 
As we have discussed earlier classes are going to be an integrated unit 
consisting of the data and the functions that would act upon the data. 
The Employee class would be something like this: 
VB.Net 
Public Class Employee 
    Dim Empid As Integer 
    Dim EmpName As String 
    Dim EmpAddress As String 
    Dim Basic As Double 
          Public Sub AddDetails () 
 --------- --------- 
          End Sub 
Public Sub PrintDetails () 
 --------- --------- 
          End Sub 
Public Sub CalcSalary () 
 --------- --------- 
          End Sub 
End Class 
 
      C# 
 
 
The attributes in our employee entity are defined as data members and the 
functionalities would be the member functions. So our classes happen to be 
independent entities in our application. Dependant upon the application the 
number of classes in the application might vary. We need to be a bit careful 
about the design of our classes specifically when we decide the data members 
and the member functions. We will have to ensure complete atomicity and that 
no class would be allowed to access the data of any other class unless it’s a 
strict constraint in the design of the classes. 
 
Then just by declaring he class we have laid down a specification. The class 
would be actually in form or will be allocated memory only when we create an 
instance of that class i.e. creating an “object” of the class. Therefore, a class is 
just a blue print of an entity, which just tells what does the entity have, and how 
does the entity behave. 
public class Employee 
{ 
    int  Empid; 
    string  EmpName; 
    string  EmpAddress; 
    double Basic; 
 
          public void AddDetails () 
 { 
          --------- 
  --------- 
            } 
public void PrintDetails () 
{ 
          --------- 
  --------- 
} 
public void CalcSalary () 
{ 
          --------- 
  --------- 
            } 
} 
Based upon the program requirement we can have this object created either at 
compilation time (stack segment of the process memory) or at runtime (on the 
heap). But if the object is created at runtime it will also be necessary to de
allocate the object to avoid a memory leak. .NET framework provides us with an 
automatic memory management system. In addition, for this system to monitor 
our memory its mandatory to have all our objects created at runtime. Hence, in 
.NET scenario we are going to have only heap-based objects, which would get 
created at runtime. 
At times we might in our application require multiple instances of the same class.  
The multiple objects of the class are going to have only their set of data members 
and they would share the copy of member functions. Then how would the data of 
the appropriate object get modified. As like any other programming language, the 
.NET languages also support the “this” reference, which would be an implicit 
argument of every function (non static function). This reference contains the 
address of the object through which the function was called. 
Just as an application would require multiple instances of a same class an 
application also might require objects of different classes. These classes might 
be from different libraries. There are high chances that two different libraries 
might have a class of the same name. These naming clashes are solved in .NET 
by grouping classes logically in namespaces. So we can group different classes 
of a library into one or more namespaces. Whenever we use a library, we can 
specify to the compiler about the namespace we are referring. 
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is all about hiding the data and ensuring its security. The data 
should not be accessible to any external entity unless the data is not that crucial.  
C# and VB.NET support various access specifiers to encapsulate the data and 
the functions. The specifiers allow us to define the levels of access for the data 
members. Every member that we declare in a class has to have to its access 
specifiers as a part of the declaration statement itself. Unlike C++ , both C# and 
VB.NET do not support access grouping.  
C# Access Specifiers 
Access 
Do not require an object instance 
Non static members 
Are termed as class level members 
Require an object instance 
Are termed as object level 
members 
Static functions do not receive the 
“this” pointer as an implicit argument 
Non static functions do receive 
the “this” pointer as an implicit 
member 
Can access only other static and not 
the non static members 
Can access both static as well as 
non static members 
Constructors
Constructors are special member functions, which are used for initializing the 
class data members. In the earlier object oriented programming languages 
constructors were quite important since initialization of the data members was 
not allowed at the time of declaration. C# however allows us to have the member 
variables to be initialized along with declarations. Then why are constructors 
required? Well, the variables may not always be initialized to some constants but 
can also be initialized with the values specified by the user. There can also be 
certain kind of processing to be done while a class is instantiated. So a 
constructor happens to be quite important member function in the class as far as 
initialization is concerned. 
C# supports following types of constructors 
• Default Constructors 
• Parameterized constructors 
• Private constructors 
• Static constructors 
Destructors
C# also supports automatic memory cleanup by having a garbage collector 
element. So no more botheration for de-allocating memory from the heap and no 
more nightmares about dangling pointers. Then if there is a memory 
management mechanism why would we require destructors? 
Static Members
Let us consider a scenario wherein we have two different MS WORD windows 
opened with some documents opened. We select some text from one of the 
windows, copy it and try to paste it another window. Now we know that both 
these windows happen to be two separate entities. So lets imagine two objects of 
the same kind to have similar kind of interaction. Definitely we would a common 
memory are which both the objects would be able to access. This memory area 
also has to restricted to the objects of that class only. The key point over here is 
the common area available to the objects. 
In a second scenario, let us consider a requirement of generating ids 
automatically. Again, there has to be some variable, which would be common to 
all objects of that class and would keep on incrementing.  
Static

Object #1 
Object #2

Note:-- All the object are instances of the same class and the static variable also
belongs to the same class

argument 
Non static functions do receive 
the “this” pointer as an implicit 
member 
Can access only other static and 
not the non static members 
Can access both static as well as 
non static members 
Properties
Classes were proposed in object oriented programming paradigm for one of the 
reasons of having data security. As we know, the members of a structure in C 
happen to be public and can be accessed freely outside the structure. As a 
result, there is not any check as to what data is been inserted into the structure 
members. Hence, in classes we have the “private” specifier by which we can 
avoid the direct access of the data members of the class. Then we lose the user 
friendliness of accessing a variable rather than calling a function. 
Properties happen to be a fantastic blend of both the things. A property 
constitutes of a private level member to store the data and accessor and mutator 
methods to interact with the variable. Now what is new in that? The beauty is that 
the property would be accessed by the user as a local variable but internally the 
compiler will convert the access statements into appropriate function calls. So the 
user application always is under the impression that a variable is been accessed 
where as the validity of the data is been checked with the methods associated. 
The data stored in the variable is termed as value of the property. 
Inheritence
It is one of the commonly used features in OOPS to avoid the code duplication. It 
implements code reutilization in class declaration. Let us take an example and 
discuss how the code reutilization is achieved with inheritence. Normally we 
create a singe class to represent an entity and its operations. Look at the 
following example 
Employee Class 
Class Employee 
Public EmpId As Integer 
Private Sal As Double = 0 
Public Basic As Double 
Public Allowance As Double 
Public Deducions As Double 
Public FirstName As String 
Public LastName As String 
Public Address As String 
Public Pincode As String 
Public Sub DisplayInfo() 
Dim msg As String 
msg = FirstName & " " & LastName & vbCrLf 
msg = msg & Address & vbCrLf 
msg = msg & "PIN – " & Pincode 
Msgbox(msg) 
End Sub 
Public ReadOnly Property Salary() As Double 
Get 
Return Sal 
End Get 
End Property 
Public Sub ProcessSalary() 
Sal = Basic + Allowance - Deductions 
End Sub 
End Class 
class Employee 
{ 
    public int EmpId; 
    private double Sal = 0; 
    public double Basic; 
    public double Allowance; 
    public double Deducions; 
    public string FirstName; 
    public string LastName; 
    public string Address; 
    public string Pincode; 
    public void  DisplayInfo() 
   { 
        string msg; 
        msg = FirstName + " " + LastName + vbCrLf; 
        msg = msg + Address + vbCrLf; 
        msg = msg + "PIN – " + Pincode; 
        MesssgeBox.Show(msg); 
    } 
    public double Salary 
    { 
        get 
        {        
            return Sal; 
         }    
    } 
    public void ProcessSalary() 
    { 
        Sal = Basic + Allowance – Deductions; 
    } 
} 
 
 
In the above example, employee class contains methods and properties defined 
in its structure. Employee object is an instance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Customer 
Class 
Customer 
Object 
Class Customer 
    Public CustId As Integer 
    Public DebitBalance As Double 
    Public FirstName As String 
    Public LastName As String 
    Public Address As String 
    Public Pincode As String 
    Public Sub DisplayInfo() 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = FirstName & " " & LastName & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & Address & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "PIN – " & Pincode 
    End Sub 
    Public ReadOnly Property Debit() As Double 
        Get 
            Return DebitBalance 
        End Get 
    End Property 
End Class 
 
class Customer 
{ 
    public int CustId; 
    public double DebitBalance;  
    public string FirstName; 
    public string LastName; 
    public string Address; 
    public string Pincode; 
    public void DisplayInfo() 
    { 
        string msg; 
        msg = FirstName + " " + LastName ; 
        msg = msg + Address ; 
        msg = msg + "PIN – " ; 
    } 
    public double Debit() 
    { 
        get 
         { 
            return DebitBalance; 
         } 
    } 
} 
 
 
Customer class contains methods and properties defined in its structure. 
Customer object is an instance. 
In these two classes, you might have observed the person identification is same 
in both Employee and Customer class. it means firstname, lastname, address 
and pincode variable members and displayInfo method is same in both the 
classes. 
 
So this common information can be isolated and written in separate class and 
inherited into the respective employee and customer class. it is shown in the 
following example. 
 
Base Class:- 
 
Class Person 
    Public FirstName As String 
    Public LastName As String 
    Public Address As String 
    Public Pincode As String 
    Public Sub DisplayInfo() 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = FirstName & " " & LastName & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & Address & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "PIN – " & Pincode 
        Msgbox(msg) 
    End Sub 
End Class 
 
 
class Person 
{ 
    public string FirstName; 
    public string LastName; 
    public string Address; 
    public string Pincode;

In the above mentioned example Person class holds the common data 
(Firstname, Lastname… etc) and method displayInfo(). It has been inherited in 
both employee and customer class. So these two achieves the same functionality 
of what we have seen before inheritance. By this point we conclude inheritance 
implements reuse of the same code with multiple classes. 
One more advantage with inheritance is extensibility of the of the derived class 
code. It means the employee and customer class be extended by including its 
own methods and properties with the person (Inherited) class. Here the extended 
members in Employee class are EmpId, Allowance, ProcessSalary method and 
Salary property. The same thing follows in customer class with CustId, 
DebitBalance and Debit property. 
You might have observed the keywords Base class and Derived class in the 
above session. Let us see what it means. 
Base class:
 A class which contains common properties and methods that can 
shared with other classes by inheritance is called Base class. Ex:- Person class 
Derived class:- 
A class which inherits the base class is knows as Derived class. 
ex:- Employee class and Customer class. 
Implementation:
 A derived class can inherit only one base class. its shown in 
the above examples, ie., employee class inherits person class and customer 
class inherits person class. 
You can inherit the base class into derived class using Inherits keyword. 
ex:-   
Class Employee 
Inherits Person 
  :
  :
End Class 
class Employee:Person 
{ 
  :
  :
} 
Protected Keyword:- 
keyword. 
We have already seen the usage of Public and Private 
As we know, all the Public keyword declarations in the class will be accessed by 
the object users and the derived class (the class which inherits the base class). 
Private keyword declarations can be accessed only within the class (it means 
the class in which the declaration is done). 
You may think why this Protected keyword declaration is required. 
Its functionality is a hybrid of public and protected keyword. So, its very important 
in class inheritance, because in the situation where the data is to be 
communicated only between the base and derived classes irrespective of the 
external object user (means the end user) the protected keyword is used 
Let us take an example and see how it will be used 
 
Base Class:- 
 
Class Person 
    Public FirstName As String 
    Public LastName As String 
    Public Address As String 
    Public Pincode As String 
    Protected DateOFBirth As DateTime 
    Public Sub DisplayInfo() 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = FirstName & " " & LastName & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & Address & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "PIN – " & Pincode 
        msg = msg & "Date of Birth : " & DateOFBirth.ToString 
    End Sub 
End Class 
 
class Person 
{ 
    public string FirstName ; 
    public string LastName ; 
    public string Address; 
    public string Pincode; 
    protected DateTime DateOFBirth ; 
    public void  DisplayInfo() 
    { 
        string msg; 
        msg = FirstName + " " + LastName; 
        msg = msg + Address ; 
        msg = msg + "PIN – " + Pincode; 
        msg = msg + "Date of Birth : " + DateOFBirth.toString; 
    } 
} 
 
 
The Protected variable dateofbirth is accessed in the displayinfo method of the 
base class itself. 
 
Derived Class:- 
 
Class Employee 
    Inherits Person 
    Public EmpId As Integer 
    Private Sal As Double = 0 
    Public Basic As Double 
    Public Allowance As Double 
    Public Deducions As Double 
    Public ReadOnly Property Salary() As Double 
        Get 
            Return Sal 
        End Get 
    End Property 
    Public Sub ProcessSalary() 
        Sal = Basic + Allowance – Deductions 
    End Sub 
    Public ReadOnly Property Age() As Integer 
        Get 
            Dim personAge As Integer 
            personAge = Date.Now.Subtract(DateofBirth).Days 
            Return personAge 
        End Get 
    End Property 
End Class 
 
 
class Employee: Person 
{ 
    public int EmpId ; 
    private double Sal = 0; 
    public double Basic; 
    public double Allowance; 
    public double Deducions; 
    public double Salary 
    { 
        get 
        { 
            return Sal; 
 
        } 
    } 
    public void ProcessSalary() 
    { 
        Sal = Basic + Allowance – Deductions; 
    } 
    public int Age 
    { 
        get 
        { 
            int personage; 
            personAge = Date.Now.Subtract(DateofBirth).Days; 
            return personage; 
 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
As in the same way of base class the protected variable dateofbirth of the base 
class is accessed in the derived class. So the protected variable in the base 
class looks like a private variable for the derived class and cannot be accessed 
by its object users (means outside the class environment). 
 
Instantiation of the Derived Class :- After declaration of the derived class we 
can create the object instance of the derived class and use it for the specific task. 
This is called Object Instantiation. With the instance of the derived class you can 
access all the public properties and methods of both the base and derived 
classes.  
 
Let us take an employee class example. 
 
  Dim objEmployee1 As New Employee() 'Create an Instance of the 
        'Employee class 
        objEmployee1.EmpId = 100     'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.firstname = "Rama"   'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.lastname = "S"    'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.Address = "#8, Kalidasa road, Mysore" 
              'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.pin = "570002"    'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.Basic = 5000    'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.allowances = 4000   'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.Deductions = 1000   'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.ProcessSalary()    'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.DisplayInfo()    'Base Class member 
 
 
  Employee objEmployee1 =  new Employee(); 'Create an Instance of the 'Employee 
class 
        objEmployee1.EmpId = 100;    'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.firstname = "Rama";  'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.lastname = "S";    'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.Address = "#8, Kalidasa road, Mysore"; 
              'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.pin = "570002";    'Base Class member 
        objEmployee1.Basic = 5000;    'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.allowances = 4000;   'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.Deductions = 1000 ;  'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.ProcessSalary();    'Derived Class member 
        objEmployee1.DisplayInfo();    'Base Class member 
 
In the above code, object instance objEmployee of Employee class is created. 
And then all the public members of both base and derived class are accessed 
and manipulated. 
System.Object:- 
 This is the root class for all the objects in the .NET framework, 
from which all the other classes are derived. It contains some basic methods and 
properties, which can be accessed from all the object instances of the .NET 
framework. 
Look into the code which calls system.object methods. 
Dim Obj As New System.Object() 
 Obj.ToString()   
 Obj.GetHashCode() 
 Obj.GetType() 
Dim objEmployee As New Employee() 
 objEmployee.ToString()   
 objEmployee.GetHashCode() 
 objEmployee.GetType() 
System.Object Obj = new System.Object(); 
 Obj.ToString();   
 Obj.GetHashCode(); 
 Obj.GetType(); 
Employee objEmployee = New Employee(); 
 objEmployee.ToString();   
 objEmployee.GetHashCode(); 
 objEmployee.GetType(); 
The above code shows some of the methods that can be accessed 
directly with the instance of the system.object ie., Obj and also the same 
methods can be accessed from objEmployee too.  So, objEmployee is inherited 
from System.Object class. 
6.8 Polymorphism 
It is the capability to have methods and properties in multiple classes that have 
the same name can be used interchangeably, even though each class 
implements the same properties or methods in different ways. 
Let us understand what is polymorphism with the following example. 
Now we will consider the maintenance of company information which includes 
employee and customer details. A person (base class) is defined to hold the 
common information of the individual. The base class maintains contact 
information of the person and manipulates the data. It contains save method to 
update the contact information of the person. 
Two derived classes, Employee and Customer are used to process the employee 
and customer details. These two derived classes inherits person class to 
manipulate identity of the person instead of rewriting the same code again in the 
derived classes. Since each derived class needs to use the displayinfo method to 
display the additional information with the contact details, the displayinfo method 
of the base class will be overwritten in the respective derived class using 
overrides keyword. The overriding member signature in the derived class must 
be as the base class signature.  
Signature includes the member type, member name, parameters datatype and 
return datatype. 
Look into the following example and see the implementation of base class 
(Person) and the derived class (Employee), observe the changes in the 
displayInfo method in both the classes. 
Ex:- 
Class Person 
    Private Name As String 
    Private Address As String 
    Public ReadOnly Property PName() As String 
        Get 
            Return Name 
        End Get 
    End Property 
    Public ReadOnly Property PAddress() As String 
        Get 
            Return Address 
        End Get 
    End Property 
    Public Overridable Function DisplayInfo() As String 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = "Name : " & Name & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Address : " & Address & vbCrLf 
        Return msg 
    End Function 
    Public Sub Save(ByVal parName As String, ByVal parAddress As String) 
        Name = parName 
        Address = parAddress 
    End Sub 
End Class 
 
 
class Person 
{ 
    private string Name; 
    pPrivate string Address; 
    public string PName() 
    { 
        get 
        { 
            return Name; 
        } 
    } 
    public string Paddress 
    {  
        get 
        {     
            return Address; 
        } 
    } 
    public virtual string  DisplayInfo() 
    { 
        string msg; 
        msg = "Name : " + Name; 
        msg = msg + "Address : " + Address; 
        return msg; 
    } 
    public void Save(string parName, string parAddress) 
    { 
        Name = parName; 
        Address = parAddress; 
    } 
} 
 
Derived Class:- 
 
Class Employee 
    Inherits Person 
    Public EmpId As Integer 
    Private Sal As Double = 0 
    Public Basic As Double 
    Public Allowance As Double 
    Public Deductions As Double 
    Public Overrides Function DisplayInfo() As String 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = MyBase.DispalyInfo() 
        msg = msg & "ID : " & EmpId.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Basic : " & Basic.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Allowances : " & Allowance.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Deductions : " & Deductions.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Net Salary : " & Sal.ToString & vbCrLf 
   return(msg) 
    End Function 
    Public ReadOnly Property Salary() As Double 
        Get 
            Return Sal 
        End Get 
    End Property 
    Public Sub ProcessSalary() 
        Sal = Basic + Allowance - Deductions 
    End Sub 
End Class 
  
  
class Employee: Person 
{ 
    public int EmpId; 
    private double Sal = 0; 
    public double Basic; 
    public double Allowance; 
    public double Deductions; 
    public override string DisplayInfo() 
    {       
        string msg ; 
        msg = base.DispalyInfo(); 
        msg = msg + "ID : " + EmpId.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Basic : " + Basic.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Allowances : " + Allowance.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Deductions : " + Deductions.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Net Salary : " + Sal.ToString ; 
   return(msg) 
    } 
    public double Salary 
    {         
        get 
        {   
            return Sal; 
        } 
    } 
    public void ProcessSalary() 
    {            
        Sal = Basic + Allowance – Deductions; 
    } 
} 
  
The following keywords are used in achieving polymorphism. 
 
• Overridable:- A method or property defined in the base class can be 
overwritten in the derived class. 
• Overrides:- Indicates the method or property is being overwritten in the 
derived class. 
• Mustoverrides:- A method or property defined in the base class must be 
overwritten in the derived class 
• Notoverridable:- A method or property defined in the base class must not 
be overwritten in the derived class. 
 
 Virtual Members :-Virtual members are those that can be overridden and 
replaced by the derived classes. They are declared with Overridable keyword. 
The methods or properties which doesn’t contain overridable keyword are called 
Non-Virtual members. 
For ex:- DisplayInfo method is an virtual method of Person base class, because it 
has been overwritten in the Employee derived class with new DisplayInfo method 
with same signature. 
Restricting Polymorphism :
We have already seen polymorphism is implemented with Overridable and 
Overrides keyword. Some situation arises where we need to break the 
polymorphism effect of the base class method. It means changing the signature 
of the base class member while overriding it in the derived class violates the 
polymorhism rule “signatures must be same”. Restriction is required to 
completely change the implementation of the member in the derived class. So it 
restricts the polymorphism of the base class member with new implementation in 
the derived class. The Shadow keyword used to implement this concept. 
Take an example shown below which contains two classes 1) Person Class 2) 
Employee class. 
Person class is a base class contains method to be overwritten from the derived 
class. The signature of the overridable method is  
Public Overridable Function DisplayInfo() as String 
Employee class is a derived class which inherits person class and restricts the 
implementation of the polymorphism method displayinfo of the base class with 
shadows keyword.  
Public Shadows Sub DisplayInfo() 
From the above explanation, we can observe that the signature of the DisplayInfo 
member is changed from function in the base class to the subroutine in the 
derived class with complete change in the implementation. 
Ex:- 
Base Class:-  
Class Person 
    Public Name As String 
    Public Address As String 
    Public Overridable Function DisplayInfo() As String 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = Name & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & Address & vbCrLf 
        Return msg 
    End Function 
    Public Sub Save(ByVal parName As String, ByVal parAddress As String) 
        name = parName 
        address = parAddress 
    End Sub 
End Class 
 
 
 
class Person 
{ 
    public string Name; 
    public string Address ; 
    public virtual string DisplayInfo() 
    { 
        string msg; 
        msg = Name ; 
        msg = msg + Address; 
        return msg; 
    } 
    public void Save(string parName, string parAddress) 
    { 
        name = parName; 
        address = parAddress; 
    } 
} 
Derived Class:- 
Class Employee 
Inherits Person 
Public EmpId As Integer 
Private Sal As Double = 0 
Public Basic As Double 
Public Allowance As Double 
Public Deductions As Double 
Public Shadows Sub DisplayInfo() 
Dim msg As String 
msg = MyBase.DisplayInfo("") 
msg = msg & "ID : " & EmpId.ToString & vbCrLf 
msg = msg & "Basic : " & Basic.ToString & vbCrLf 
msg = msg & "Allowances : " & Allowance.ToString & vbCrLf 
msg = msg & "Deductions : " & Deductions.ToString & vbCrLf 
msg = msg & "Net Salary : " & Basic.ToString & vbCrLf 
MsgBox(msg) 
End Sub 
Public ReadOnly Property Salary() As Double 
Get 
Return Sal 
End Get 
End Property 
Public Sub ProcessSalary() 
Sal = Basic + Allowance - Deductions 
End Sub 
End Class 
class Employee: Person 
{ 
    public int EmpId ; 
    private double Sal = 0; 
    public double Basic; 
    public double Allowance; 
    public double Deductions; 
    public new void DisplayInfo 
    { 
        string msg; 
        msg = Base.DisplayInfo(""); 
        msg = msg + "ID : " + EmpId.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Basic : " + Basic.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Allowances : " + Allowance.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Deductions : " + Deductions.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Net Salary : " + Basic.ToString; 
        MessageBox.Show(msg); 
    } 
    public double Salary 
    { 
        get 
        { 
            return Sal; 
        } 
    } 
    public void ProcessSalary() 
    {          
        Sal = Basic + Allowance – Deductions; 
    } 
} 
 
 
 
6.9 Abstract Classes (Virtual Class) 
 
So far, we have seen how to inherit the class, how to overload and override 
methods. In the examples shown in inheritance topic, parent class has been 
useful in both inheritance and create an instance also.  
Actually in some situation the classes are required only for inheritance, such type 
of classes are called Abstract classes. This concept is very useful when 
creating a framework for the applications where there will not be any 
implementation for the methods and properties in the abstract class. It just 
defines the structure. 
Abstract classes are declared using MustInherit and MustOverride keyword.  
 
Syntax:- 
Public MustInherit Class AbstractBaseClass 
Public MustOverride Sub DoSomething() 
Public MustOverride Sub DoOtherStuff() 
End Class 
public abstract class AbstractBaseClass 
{ 
 public abstract void DoSomething(); 
 public abstract void DoOtherStuff(); 
} 
MustInherit keyword is used with the class name, where as MustOverride 
keyword is used with the members of the class. 
Implementaion:- 
Public Class DerivedClass 
Inherits AbstractBaseClass 
Public Overrides Sub DoSomething() 
MsgBox("This method is overrides the Base class DoSomething to implement the 
method functionality”) 
End Sub 
Public Overrides Sub DoOtherStuff() 
MsgBox(“This method is overrides the Base class DoOtherStuff  to implement the 
method functionality”) 
End Sub 
End Class 
public class DerivedClass : AbstractBaseClass 
{ 
 public Override void DoSomething() 
 { 
MessagegBox.Show("This method is overrides the Base class DoSomething to 
implement the method functionality”); 
} 
 public Override void DoOtherStuff() 
 { 
MessaggeBox.Show(“This method is overrides the Base class DoOtherStuff  to 
implement the method functionality”); 
} 
} 
MustInherit forces the classes to be inherited from the derived class and write 
an implementation code for the methods and properties in the derived class 
before using it.  
As in the above example, any class that inherits AbstractBaseClass must 
implement the Dosomething and DoOtherStuff methods.  
We cannot create an instance of the AbstractBaseClass as shown below. 
Dim obj as New AbstractBaseClass()  
‘Error in Decleration 
AbstractBaseClass obj = new AbstractBaseClass()  
‘Error in Decleration 
Restricting Inheritence
If we want to prevent a class being used as a Base class we can use 
NotInheritable keyword with the class declaration. 
 
Public NotInheritable Class NormalClass 
    'Decleration of Class members 
End Class 
 
public sealed class NormalClass 
{ 
    'Decleration of Class members 
} 
 
For example when we want an employee class need not to be used as a Base 
class, we can declare the employee class structure with NotInheritable keyword. 
So that it can be used only for instantiation. 
 
VB.NET 
 
Class NotInheritable Employee 
    Inherits Person 
    Public EmpId As Integer 
    Private Sal As Double = 0 
    Public Basic As Double 
    Public Allowance As Double 
    Public Deductions As Double 
    Public Shadows Sub DisplayInfo() 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = MyBase.DisplayInfo("") 
        msg = msg & "ID : " & EmpId.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Basic : " & Basic.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Allowances : " & Allowance.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Deductions : " & Deductions.ToString & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "Net Salary : " & Basic.ToString & vbCrLf 
        MsgBox(msg) 
    End Sub 
    Public ReadOnly Property Salary() As Double 
        Get 
            Return Sal 
        End Get 
    End Property 
    Public Sub ProcessSalary() 
        Sal = Basic + Allowance - Deductions 
    End Sub 
End Class 
 
 
Following decleration is not posssible, .NET generates error!!!! 
Public Class Staff 
Inherits Employee  
End Class 
 
C# 
class sealed Employee: Person 
{ 
    public int EmpId ; 
    private double Sal = 0; 
    public double Basic; 
    public double Allowance; 
    public double Deductions; 
    public new void DisplayInfo 
    { 
        string msg; 
        msg = Base.DisplayInfo(""); 
        msg = msg + "ID : " + EmpId.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Basic : " + Basic.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Allowances : " + Allowance.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Deductions : " + Deductions.ToString; 
        msg = msg + "Net Salary : " + Basic.ToString; 
        MessageBox.Show(msg); 
    } 
    public double Salary 
    { 
        get 
        { 
            return Sal; 
        } 
    } 
    public void ProcessSalary() 
    {          
        Sal = Basic + Allowance – Deductions; 
    } 
} 
 
Following decleration is not posssible, .NET generates error!!!!

6.10 Interfaces 
 
An interface is like an abstract class which allows the derived class to inherit 
more than one interfaces into it.  
We have already seen an abstract class can have methods with or without 
implementation. But an interface can only have members without 
implementation. So it provides only structure of the objects like abstract class. 
To implement an interface in VB.NET, we use the keyword Implements and we  
must provide implementations for all the methods of the interface we implements. 
 
Defining an Interface:- Interfaces are declared with the following structure 
Public Interface <Name of the interface> 
 : 
<decleration of memebrs of the interface, means methods and properties  
structure> 
: 
End Interface 
Let us take up a example and see how the declaration been done 
Interface IShape 
Sub Draw(ByVal coord() As ArrayList) 
End Interface 
interface IShape 
{ 
void Draw(ArrayList coord); 
} 
Implementation of Interface:- Interfaces are implemented using Implements keyword. All the 
members of the interface are implemented with Implements keyword. 
 “To implement a interface, we must implement all the methods and properties defined by the 
interface” 
If more than one interface is to be implemented, then interfaces names should separated by 
commas with the implements keyword while defining a class. 
Lets us take an example of implementation:- 
Public Class Drawing 
Implements Ishape 
 Public Sub Draw(ByVal parCoord() As ArrayList)         
Console.Write("Draw a Circle") 
End Sub 
End Class 
Public Class Drawing: Ishape 
{ 
   Public void Draw (ArrayList parCoord) 
   { 
  Console.Write("Draw a Circle"); 
} 
} 
In the example, we are implementing Isahpe interface, which contains Draw method into the 
Drawing Class.  
Difference between Abstract class and Interfaces 
Abstract Class 
Interface 
Only one Abstract class can be 
inherited into the derived class. 
Interfaces enable multiple inheritance 
to the object 
Members of the abstract class can or 
cannot have implemention 
Interfaces contains only the definitions 
for the menbers without implementation
When to use the interfaces in programming? 
Solution:- The situation at which we need to implement the functionalities of two 
or more objects into one derived object. So it makes the derived object to refer to 
the interface methods and properties for syntax verification. 
6.11 Delegates and Events 
Delegates:
The Delegate class is one of the most important classes to know how to use 
when programming .NET. Delegates are often described as the 'backbone of the 
event model' in VB.NET. In this we are going to introduce you to delegates 
(Sytem.Delegate class) and show you how powerful of an event mechanism 
through delegates.  
Delegates are implemented using the delegate class found in the System 
namespace. A delegate is nothing more than a class that derives from 
System.MulticastDelegate. A delegate is defined as a data structure that refers to 
a static method or to a class instance and an instance method of that class. In 
other words, a delegate can be used like a type safe pointer. You can use a 
delegate to point to a method, much like a callback or the 'AddressOf' operator in 
VB.NET. Delegates are often used for asynchronous programming and are the 
ideal method for generically defining events. 
Before you get into the actual delegate class let us see some code which 
simulates the delegate functionality through simple class code for the sake of 
understanding. We have a simple class called 'VBDelegate' with two static 
methods named 'CallDelegate' and 'DisplayMessage' as shown below. When the 
CallDelegate method is called,(when the program is run) to display the message. 
Now normally, if we had a class called 'VBDelegate' with a method named 
'DisplayMessage'  
VB.NET 
Public Class VBDelegate 
 'Static method to call displaymessage function 
Public Shared Sub CallDelegate() 
   DisplayMessage("Some Text") 
End Sub 
 'Static Function to display the message 
Private Shared Function DisplayMessage(ByVal strTextOutput As String) 
MsgBox(strTextOutput) 
  End Function 
End Class 
C# 
Public Class CSDelegate 
{ 
 'Static method to call displaymessage function 
Public static void CallDelegate() 
 { 
   DisplayMessage("Some Text") 
} 
 'Static Function to display the message 
Private static void DisplayMessage(String strTextOutput) 
 {  
 MessageBox.Show(strTextOutput) 
 } 
} 
There is nothing wrong with this approach at all. In fact, it is probably more 
commonly used than delegates. However, it does not provide much in terms of 
flexibility or a dynamic event model. With delegates, you can pass a method 
along to something else, and let it execute the method instead. Perhaps you do 
not know which method you want to call until runtime, in which case, delegates 
also come in handy. 
Now we will implement the same functionality as before, using a actual delegate 
class of .NET.  
Delegates in VB.NET are declared like: 
Delegate [Function/Sub] methodname(arg1,arg2..argN)  
The declared delegate methodname will have the same method signature as the 
methods they want to be a delegate for. This example is calling a shared 
method.. 
VB.NET 
Class VBDelegate 
'Declaration of delegate variable with arguments 
Delegate Function MyDelegate(ByVal strOutput As String) 
'Function to call the delegates 
Public Shared Sub CallDelegates() 
'Declare variables of type Mydelegate points to the  
'function MessageDisplay with AddressOf operator 
Dim d1 As New MyDelegate(AddressOf MesssageDisplay) 
Dim d2 As New MyDelegate(AddressOf MesssageDisplay) 
'Pass the arguments to the function through delegates 
   d1("First Delegation ") 
   d2("Second Delegation ") 
End Sub 
'Function to display the message 
Private Shared Function MesssageDisplay(ByVal strTextOutput As String) 
MsgBox(strTextOutput) 
End Function 
End Class 
C#  
Class CSDelegate 
{  
'Declaration of delegate variable with arguments 
 delegate void MyDelegate(String strOutput); 
'Function to call the delegates 
Public static void CallDelegates() 
 { 
'Declare variables of type Mydelegate points to the  
'function MessageDisplay  
MyDelegate d1 = New MyDelegate(MesssageDisplay); 
MyDelegate d2 = New MyDelegate(MesssageDisplay); 
'Pass the arguments to the function through delegates 
   d1("First Delegation "); 
   d2("Second Delegation "); 
} 
'Function to display the message 
Private static void MesssageDisplay(String strTextOutput) 
 {     
  MessgeBox.Show(strTextOutput); 
} 
} 
The Output to the display window is:  
First Delegation in one message window  
And  
Second Delegation in the second message window 
What has happened in the above code? Let's take a look  
First, we defined a delegate. Remember, when defining a delegate it is very 
similar to stating the signature of a method. We have said we want a delegate 
that can accept a string as an argument so basically, this delegate can work with 
any method that takes the same argument(s). 
In our CallDelagates method, we create two instances of our 'MyDelegate'. Then, 
we pass into MyDelegate's constructor the address of our 'DisplayMessage' 
method. This means that the method we pass into the delegate's constructor (in 
this case it's 'DisplayMessage' method) must have a method signature that 
accepts a string object as an input argument, just like our delegate does. Now, 
you might be thinking, "why are we passing in the address of a method when we 
defined our delegate to accept a string object as it's input argument?" In the code 
above, we are telling the delegate which method to call, not which string we're 
passing in. Carefully understand this concept. 
Then finally we have our 'DisplayMessage' method, which takes the string 
passed in by the delegate and tells it what string is to be displayed. 
The same approach is used while handling the events in the .NET. This topic is 
just to understand how delegates works in .NET. 
Events:
Events are nothing but situations at which the message is sent to an object to 
signal the occurrence of the action. These actions can be caused by the user 
interaction or within the object itself. 
For example the class designer can create an event and raise the same through 
its methods and properties. These events will be captured by the object user and 
perform his/her required operation. 
Let us take a simple example of VB.NET Button class. Button is a class defined 
in System.Controls.FormsControls nameplace. The users create an instance of 
the Button class and select the onclick event related to the button object and 
write an action to be performed on click of the button. 
Actually this event is already defined in button class and will be raised when the 
user clicks the button. The following example shows how the event can be 
defined, raised in the class and used by the object user. 
Declaration:- The event member will be declared with Event keyword. Basically 
the event member should always be public. Because these are the members will 
be used by the external users. 
'Declare a class which operates on the Employee collection database 
'This class is used to find some summarised operation on the Employee  
'collction database, which means finding the relavent employee ‘information, 'getting the 
total no. of employees in the collection and ‘others   -  Its just 'an example to explain how 
event works 
Public Class EmployeeCollection 
    'Declare an event which will be raised after finding the data 
    'Keyword ‘Event’ is used the declare the events 
    Public Event FindResult(ByVal blnFound As Boolean) 
'This method is to find the data from employee colletion database and 'raise the findresult 
event to return the result 
    Public Sub FindData(ByVal Name As String) 
        'find the Employee with name and return the result as boolean, if  
  'the data is found then raise FindResult with True else with  
  'False 
        Dim found As Boolean 
        found = FineEmployee(Name) 
        If found Then 
            'Raise the event with parameter 
            RaiseEvent FindResult(True) 
        Else 
            'Raise the event with parameter 
            RaiseEvent FindResult(False) 
        End If 
    End Sub 
End Class 
 
Usage:- In order to access the events of the objects, the object should be 
declared with withevents clause. This is shown in the following example with form 
load event. 
 
'Declare the object with WithEvents clause to create an instance 
Dim WithEvents objEmpColl As EmployeeCollection = New EmployeeCollection() 
Public Sub load() 
    'Find the Employee with name Rama in the Employee collection 
    objEmpColl.FindData("Rama") 
End Sub 
'The following event will be raised after the search operation 
Private Sub objObject_FindResult(ByValue blnFound as Boolean) Handles 
objObject.FindResult  
    If blnFound Then 
        MsgBox("The given Employee is Found in the collection") 
    Else 
        MsgBox("The given Employee is not Found") 
    End If 
End Sub 
 
 
6.12 Structures 
 
Structures are used to create a variable set of different datatypes in VB.NET (In 
earlier versions of VB we use TYPE and END TYPE to define it). Here it is 
defined with STRUCTURE and END STRUCTURE keyword. 
It supports allmost all the features of OOPS, like  
• Implementing interfaces  
• Constructors, methods, properties, fields, constants and events 
• Shared constructors 
 
Ex: - 
Defining the structure:- 
VB.NET 
 
Structure Person 
    Public FirstName As String 
    Public LastName As String 
    Public Address As String 
    Public Pincode As String 
    Public DateOFBirth As DateTime 
    Public Sub DisplayInfo() 
        Dim msg As String 
        msg = FirstName & " " & LastName & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & Address & vbCrLf 
        msg = msg & "PIN – " & Pincode 
        msg = msg & "Date of Birth : " & DateOFBirth.ToString 
    End Sub 
End Structure 
 
C# 
struct Person 
{ 
    Public String FirstName;  
    Public String LastName ; 
    Public String Address ; 
    Public String Pincode ; 
    Public DateTime DateOFBirth; 
    Public void DisplayInfo() 
    {       
        String msg=new String(); 
        msg = FirstName + " " + LastName ; 
        msg = msg + Address ; 
        msg = msg + "PIN – " + Pincode; 
        msg = msg + "Date of Birth : " + DateOFBirth.ToString; 
    } 
} 
 
In the example a Person structure is declared to hold the a person’s details like 
name, address, pincode etc., we have already seen this person details in terms 
of a class object. Basically the structures are used to hold the set of values like 
array. Theoritically arrays holds a set of single datatype values, but structures 
holds a set of different datatype values. Due to the OOPS feature of .NET we can 
implement the methods and properties in the structures too. This is shown in the 
person structure. Here the Firstname,Lastname,Address,Pincode,Dateofbirth are 
all the variables of person structure with different datatype declarations, where 
DisplayInfo is a method to disputably the information.  
Variables holds the data and methods operates on the data stored in it as in the 
normal class object. 
Usage of the structure:- 
VB.Net 
'Creating an instance of the structure like a normal class variable 
Dim varPerson As Person = New Person() 
'Setting the structure variables with the values 
varPerson.firstname = “Rama” 
varPerson.lastname = “Lakan” 
varPerson.address = “Mysore” 
varPerson.pincode = “570002” 
varPerson.dateofbirth = “25/06/1977” 
'Calling the strcuture method to manipulate and display the person address 
varPerson.displayinfo() 
C#   
Person varPerson =New Person(); 
'Setting the structure variables with the values 
varPerson.firstname = “Rama”; 
varPerson.lastname = “Lakan”; 
varPerson.address = “Mysore”; 
varPerson.pincode = “570002”; 
varPerson.dateofbirth = “25/06/1977”; 
'Calling the strcuture method to manipulate and display the person address 
varPerson.displayinfo(); 
6.13 Sample Application: OOPS 
Heres a small application created to demonstrate Object Oriented / Component Oriented 
features in .NET using C#.  
Accounts are created & managed by the application for a Bank. There are 2 types of 
account that can be created 
1. Savings 
2. Current 
• The opening balance for Saving account is 1000, & for Current is 5000 
• The minimum balance for Saving Account is 1000 & that for Current should not be 
less than the ODA. 
• Account ID should be auto generated, Name can be modified & Balance can be 
updated only through transactions. 
Based on the above requirement, Account component library has been built & a sample 
test application 
Note: This is a simple application to demonstrate OOPS/Component oriented features.

7. Error and Exception Handling 
Section Owner: Saurabh Nandu (MVP)
Content Contributors: Aravind Corera (MVP)
7.1 Need for Error Handling 
Picture this: You’re doing a demo of your application for a client and then all of a sudden 
as if proving Murphy’s Law, the inevitable happens. Boom! … Your client gets to see a 
dialog with cryptic messages indicating that your application has crashed. You certainly 
wish that such a thing should never ever happen, but that wish would hold true only in an 
ideal world. The truth however is that unforeseen errors are bound to happen, one way or 
another in spite of careful coding accompanied with fairly rigorous testing. Keeping this 
in mind, we as developers need to adopt defensive coding strategies with effective error 
handling techniques to trap and handle errors and exceptions, and to provide the user with 
adequate information on the nature and cause of the error before exiting from the 
application when an unexpected error occurs.  
An Exception is an abnormal/exceptional/unexpected condition that disrupts the normal 
execution of an application. A distinction needs to be made between expected conditions 
and unexpected conditions. Say for example you are writing a very large file to the 
hard-disk, it’s imperative that you should first check the disk space first, since there could 
be an expected condition that the hard-disk might be low on space, such conditions are 
not ideal candidates that warrant exceptions to be thrown. But on the contrary, what if an 
unexpected hard-disk hardware failure occurred while writing to the file - This is an ideal 
candidate that warrants exceptions to be thrown. Always remember that though exception 
handling is very important, judicious use of this feature should be made since there is a 
performance cost when you use it. 
Error and exception handling are a part and parcel of every good language, framework 
class library, or application and should form a part of your applications too right from the 
planning stages. The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) and Common Language 
Runtime (CLR) provide a rich infrastructure to catch and handle exceptions. The CLR 
infrastructure is also designed for cross-language exception handling - What this means is 
that if a VB.NET component throws back an exception to a C# application that’s 
consuming the component, the C# application will be able to catch the error and obtain 
rich error information on the error that has occurred.  Through the rest of the tutorial, 
we’ll see how to catch and handle exceptions in the .NET framework using C# and 
VB.NET. 
7.2 Old-school unstructured exception handling in VB 6.0 and its 
disadvantages 
 
You are well aware that the exception-handling model in VB 6.0 required you to jump 
through hoops in order to handle errors and gracefully exit from a procedure or function. 
The exception-handling model that VB 6.0 supported was unstructured and required you 
to make jumps to a label or a line number that contained the error-handling code to 
handle the error. Further more, you had to take precautions to exit the procedure in a 
normal execution flow (when no error occurs) by not allowing it to fall through to the 
error-handling block. If you had clean up code that was supposed to execute both when 
an error occurred as well as during a normal execution flow, then you had to make yet 
another jump to a label or line number that contains the block of cleanup code. The whole 
approach was unstructured and often got very messy. To see what we mean, and why this 
method of exception handling can be best termed as unstructured, recollect fond nostalgic 
memories at how you typically handled exceptions in VB 6.0 using the code snippet 
shown below, and be prepared to bid goodbye to this pattern of exception handling: 
 
 
Private Sub BookTicketsForMovie() 
 
    On Error GoTo BookTickets_ErrHandler 
     
    ' Perform business logic to book tickets. 
    ' Possibility that exceptions could be raised here, say when all  
    ' tickets are sold out. 
     
BookTickets_Exit: 
 
    ' Ignore any errors here since this is just a resource clean up block 
    On Error Resume Next 
     
    ' Resource clean up occurs here  
    ' Maybe close up the DB Connection to the movie ticket database and so on 
     
    'Exit the procedure 
    Exit Sub 
 
BookTickets_ErrHandler: 
 
    ' Handle the error based on the error type. 
    ' Need to pick up the value of Err.Number and then decide accordingly  
    ' how to handle the error. 
     
    MsgBox "Error encountered is: " & Err.Number 
    MsgBox "Error message is: " & Err.Description 
 
    ' Go through the usual cleanup procedure before exiting the procedure 
    Resume BookTickets_Exit 
 
End Sub 
 
 
As seen above, you typically use an On Error GoTo … statement to redirect any errors to 
error-handling code marked by a label or line number, such as the BookTickets_ErrHandler 
handler in our example. The VB 6.0 runtime populates the Err object that contains all the 
details about the error that occurred, whose properties can be examined for the error type 
that occurred and then a decision can be taken as to how to handle that error. This is a 
really cumbersome task if your program is capable of generating a lot of error types, 
since we need through the rigmarole of determining the exact type of error that occurred 
using decision statements such as Select…Case or If…Then…Else before actually handling 
it. If you had cleanup code that needs to be executed before exit from the procedure, such 
as the one under the BookTickets_Exit label in our example, then you had to make an 
additional jump to the cleanup code or call a common cleanup procedure. As a result, the 
code becomes very unstructured and difficult to maintain, thus allowing occasional bugs 
to creep in silently. VB.NET supports this form of unstructured exception handling too. 
But it’s generally not recommended that you use unstructured exception handling in 
VB.NET because of performance constraints and code maintenance nightmares. 
It is recommended that use VB.NET’s structured approach to handling errors, which is 
the topic of our next section. So be prepared to say a tearful goodbye to unstructured 
exception handling and say a big hello to the über powerful world of structured exception 
handling. 
7.3 Structured Exception Handling in C#/VB.NET 
Structured Exception Handling (SEH) allows you enclose code that can possibly 
encounter errors or raise exceptions within a protected block. You can define exception 
handler filters that can catch specific exception types thrown by the code within the 
protected block. Lastly, you can create a block of cleanup code that guarantees to execute 
always – both when an exception is thrown as well as on a normal execution path. 
C# and VB.NET supports the following SEH keywords to raise and handle exceptions: 
try 
throw 
catch 
finally 
To facilitate structured exception handling in C#/VB.NET, you typically enclose a block 
of code that has the potential of throwing exceptions within a try block. A catch handler 
associated with the exception that is thrown catches the exception. There can be one or 
more catch handlers and each catch handler can be associated with a specific exception 
type that it can handle. The catch blocks are generally used to gracefully inform the user 
of the error and to possibly log the error to a log file or to the system event log. You can 
optionally have a finally block that contains code that will execute both when an 
execution is thrown as well as on a normal execution flow. In other words, code within 
the finally block is guaranteed to always execute and usually contains cleanup code. So 
how can you raise an exception? . To do that your code needs to throw an exception using 
the throw keyword. The exception that is thrown is an object that is derived from the 
System.Exception class. We’ll examine this class in detail in the next section. 
Now let’s consider a normal execution flow in a program where no error occurs within 
the try block.  
Explanation in C# 
Explanation in VB.NET 
In this case, the code within the try block does not throw an exception and therefore, the 
code within the catch block never executes. Once the code within the try block completes, 
the execution path resumes by executing the code in the finally block. As mentioned 
earlier, the code within the finally block executes whether or not an error had occurred. 
Let’s turn our attention to a scenario where the code within the try block raises an 
exception.  
Explanation in C# 
Explanation in VB.NET   
When the exception is thrown, execution flow is transferred to the catch block that is 
capable of handling the exception thus skipping the rest of the code below the line that 
threw the exception in the try block. The code in the catch block handles the exception 
appropriately and then execution flow moves to the code in the finally block. 
7.4 System.Exception: The mother of all exceptions 
Let’s take some time to look at the parent exception class in the .NET framework – the 
System.Exception class. All exception classes are directly or indirectly derived from this 
class.  
To see how to put this class to use, let’s quickly dive into a simple example where we can 
see all the exception handling constructs (try, catch, throw, and finally) in action. To start 
with fire up your favorite text editor (my personal favorite is Notepad) and type in the 
following code: 
Code listing in C# 
 
using System; 
 
class HelloWorld 
{ 
   static void Main(string[] args) 
   { 
      try 
      { 
         Console.WriteLine("Here we go..."); 
 
         // Throw an exception 
         throw new Exception("Oops !. Your computer is on fire !!"); 
 
         // This line should never execute 
         Console.WriteLine("How on earth did I get called ?"); 
      } 
      catch(System.Exception ex) 
      { 
         // Display the error message 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught exception : {0}", ex.Message); 
      } 
      finally 
      { 
         // This should always get called 
         Console.WriteLine("In finally"); 
      } 
   } 
} 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Imports System 
 
Module HelloWorld 
 
   ' The Main entry point of the application 
   Sub Main() 
 
      Try 
 
         Console.WriteLine("Here we go...") 
 
         ' Throw an exception 
         Throw New Exception("Oops !. Your computer is on fire !!") 
    
         ' This line should never execute 
         Console.WriteLine("How on earth did I get called ?") 
 
      Catch ex As Exception 
          
         Console.WriteLine("Caught exception : {0}", ex.Message) 
 
      Finally   
 
         ' This should always get called 
         Console.WriteLine("In finally") 
 
      End Try 
 
End Sub 
End Module 
So what we have here is a try block that throws an exception by creating an instance of 
the System.Exception class with a descriptive error message. There’s a catch block to 
handle exceptions of type System.Exception. The code in the catch block just displays the 
error message. Finally, the finally block (no pun intended) logs a message that confirms 
that it did execute even though an error was thrown. 
So let’s save this program to a file named HelloWorld (with the appropriate extension 
depending on the language you are using - .cs or .vb), the Hello World of Exception 
handling if you will.  
To compile the C# program, type in the following command from the DOS command 
line: 
csc  /target:exe HelloWorld.cs 
To compile the VB.NET program, type in the following command from the DOS 
command line: 
vbc  /target:exe HelloWorld.vb 
This will generate an executable named HelloWorld.exe.  Run the program and here’s the 
output that you get: 
Here we go... 
Caught exception : Oops !. Your computer is on fire !! 
In finally 
You’ll notice that the exception that was thrown is caught by the catch block and that any 
statements that occur in the try block below the line that threw the exception are not 
executed. Notice that when you compiled the program in C#, the compiler generated the 
following warning: 
Warning in C# 
HelloWorld.cs(16,4): warning CS0162: Unreachable code detected 
 
 
This goes to show that the C# compiler detected that the statement that follows the throw 
statement in the try block would never get executed because of the exception that was 
thrown, and thus warned us of unreachable code.  
 
We saw how the Message property of the System.Exception class can be used to get a 
descriptive error message for the exception. Similarly, let’s examine the some of the 
other important properties of the System.Exception class. Let’s start by modifying the catch 
block in example that we just saw with the following code: 
 
Code listing in C# 
 
// Replace the catch block in our previous example with the following code 
 
catch(System.Exception ex)

   Console.WriteLine("Info on this exception is available at : {0}",             
                     ex.HelpLink); 
   Console.WriteLine("Stack trace of this exception: {0}", ex.StackTrace); 
}

Compile and run the application and observe the output that you get: 
 
Output in C# 
 
Here we go... 
Caught exception : Oops !. Your computer is on fire !!

In finally 
 
 
 
You’ll notice that you can get rich information on the exception that occurred including 
details on the application and the method that threw the exception (through the Source and 
TargetSite properties respectively) and a complete stack trace of the exception in a string 
representation (using the StackTrace property). Note that if you compile your code in 
debug mode i.e. using the /debug+ compiler option, the Source and StackTrace properties 
will show you the actual line numbers in the source code which raised the exception. 
You’ll notice that the HelpLink property, which is supposed to provide a link to help file 
or a URL that contains information on the exception that occurred, does not seem to 
return anything. This is because we did not set this property when throwing the 
exception. To do that you simply need to set the HelpLink property before raising the 
exception. Here’s a snippet of code that shows how you can do that: 
 
Code listing in C# 
 
// Create an Exception  
Exception exception = new Exception("Oops !. Your computer is on fire !!"); 
 
// Set the help file details 
exception.HelpLink = "http://www.someurl.com/help/ComputerOnFireHelp.html"; 
 
// Throw the exception 
throw exception; 
 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
' Create an Exception 
Dim excep as Exception = New Exception("Oops !. Your computer is on fire !!") 
 
' Set the help file details 
excep.HelpLink = "http://www.someurl.com/help/ComputerOnFireHelp.html" 
 
' Throw the exception 
Throw excep 
Replacing the statement that throws the exception with the above 3 statements in our 
example application, compiling it, and running it will now yield the following results: 
Output in C# 
Here we go... 
Caught exception : Oops !. Your computer is on fire !! 
Source of the exception is : HelloWorld 
Method that threw the exception is : Main 
Info on this exception is available at: http://www.someurl.com/help/ComputerOnFireHelp.html 
Stack trace of this exception:    at HelloWorld.Main(String[] args)

In finally 
There’s one other thing that you need to be aware of - The notion of an inner exception, 
that you can access using the InnerException property of the main exception. So what 
exactly is an inner exception? . Assume that you have a nice cool stock portal that allows 
customers to manage their stocks and investments. The stock portal uses a database to 
store data on customers and their portfolio. Now, let’s say that you encounter a database 
specific error in your application. The last thing that you want to do is to display some 
cryptic ADO or OLEDB messages in your web pages that your customers don’t care a 
hang about. In such cases, you might have a catch handler to catch database specific 
exceptions. What this catch handler would essentially do is to create a more generic 
exception that is application specific (maybe an exception that tells the user that the site 
encountered an internal error) and would assign the database specific exception to the 
application-specific exception’s InnerException property. The catch handler then re-throws 
this application-specific exception expecting that one of the outer catch blocks will handle 
the generic exception. We’ll see how to re-throw exceptions in the section, Nesting 
try/catch/finally blocks and re-throwing exceptions.  Inner exceptions are very useful when 
you are dealing with exceptions that occur in multiple tiers of typical enterprise 
applications. This allows you to envelope specific exceptions that actually caused the 
error into more application-specific exception types, and at the same time allows clients 
to determine the specific exception type (InnerException) that caused the 
application-specific exception to be thrown.  
Now since we know more about the System.Exception class, let’s take a look at the types 
of exceptions and how they can be classified. Broadly, there are two types of exceptions: 
System exceptions  (Exception classes derived from System.SystemException) 
Application exceptions (Exception classes derived from 
System.ApplicationException) 
Understanding system exceptions: 
System exceptions are pre-defined exceptions that ship with the .NET framework class 
library. For example, the System.IO.IOException class, which is predefined exception in the 
framework class library for handling input/output related errors on files, streams etc., is 
derived from the System.SystemException class.  
There are tons of other similar predefined system exception classes that are defined and 
used in the FCL and which can be used in our applications as well. Let’s take a look at a 
quick example on how to handle system exceptions in your application. We’ll use the 
System.DivideByZeroException as our guinea pig here and simulate a situation where the 
FCL throws this exception. We’ll handle this error and report the error to the user. Fire up 
Notepad, and type in the following code: 
Code listing in C# 
using System; 
class MyDecimalDivider 
{ 
static void Main(string[] args) 
{ 
 try 
 { 
// Trigger a divide by zero exception 
 Decimal dResult = Decimal.Divide(5,0); 
// We should never get here  
Console.WriteLine("Result is : {0}", dResult); 
 } 
 catch(DivideByZeroException exDivByZero) 
 { 
    Console.WriteLine("Caught Divide By Zero exception: {0}", 
                             exDivByZero.Message); 
      } 
      catch(Exception ex) 
      { 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: {0}",ex.Message); 
      } 
      finally 
      { 
         // Should always execute 
         Console.WriteLine("In finally"); 
      } 
   } 
} 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Imports System 
 
Module MyDecimalDivider 
 
   Sub Main() 
 
      Try 
 
         ' Trigger a divide by zero exception 
         Dim dResult as Decimal = Decimal.Divide(5,0) 
 
         ' We should never get here  
         Console.WriteLine("Result is : {0}", dResult) 
  
      Catch exDivByZero As DivideByZeroException   
 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught Divide By Zero exception: {0}", _ 
           exDivByZero.Message) 
 
      Catch ex As Exception  
 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: {0}", ex.Message) 
 
      Finally  
 
         ' Should always execute 
         Console.WriteLine("In finally") 
 
      End Try 
 
   End Sub 
 
End Module 
 
 
 
So essentially, what we’re doing here is simulating a DivideByZeroException by calling the 
Divide() static method of the System.Decimal class and passing in a value of 0 for the 
divisor.  A quick look at the documentation for the Divide() method will tell you that the 
method throws a DivideByZeroException when attempting to divide by 0. So we’re setting 
up a catch block to handle exceptions of type System.DivideByZeroException.  
Save the file to MyDecimalDivider (with the appropriate extension .cs or .vb depending on the 
language that you are using). Let’s get down to compiling the application. Type the 
following command from the DOS command prompt: 
Compiling in C# 
csc  /target:exe MyDecimalDivider.cs  
Compiling in VB.NET 
vbc  /target:exe MyDecimalDivider.vb 
That takes care of generating an executable file named MyDecimalDivider.exe. Run the 
program and observe the output: 
Caught Divide By Zero exception: Attempted to divide by zero. 
In finally 
There we go. As seen above, the catch handler for the DivideByZeroException took care of 
catching the exception that was raised when we attempted to divide 5 by 0. The 
System.DivideByZeroException is just one of the many predefined system exception classes 
in the FCL. For a complete list of the other system exception classes, swing by to: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en
us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemsystemexceptionclasshierarchy.asp
Ordering catch handlers to filter exceptions: 
Notice that we also have another catch block that handles the generic System.Exception. If 
none of the other catch handlers can handle an exception raised, the System.Exception catch 
handler will always lend a helping hand in catching and handling the exception, since the 
rest of the exception types are derived from this class. So that brings us to another thing 
that you need to remember - If you do not have a catch handler to handle a specific 
exception type, say SomeException, but do have a catch hander that can handle a type that 
is a super class of SomeException, then the catch handler associated with that super class 
will be asked to handle the exception. In our example, even if we did not have the catch 
handler for the System.DivideByZeroException, the catch handler for the System.Exception 
would have been able to handle the exception, since System.DivideByZeroException inherits 
from System.ArithmeticException, which in turn derives from System.SystemException and 
hence System.Exception. 
 
Keeping this in mind, it is important to understand that the order in which you place your 
catch handlers plays a key role in determining the catch handler that will eventually 
handle your exceptions.  As a general rule, always place exception types of more derived 
classes in an exception class hierarchy higher up in the chain and place base class (super 
class) exception types lower down in the chain. To illustrate this, let’s slightly modify the 
earlier divide by zero example and note down a few observations: 
 
Modify the MyDecimalDivider.cs code sample as shown below to introduce a catch handler 
for the System.ArithmeticException, which is the immediate base class of the 
System.DivideByZeroException and place that catch handler above the catch handler that 
handles the DivideByZeroException:  
Code listing in C# 
 
using System; 
 
class MyDecimalDivider 
{ 
   static void Main(string[] args) 
   { 
      try 
      { 
         // Trigger a divide by zero exception 
         Decimal dResult = Decimal.Divide(5,0); 
 
         // We should never get here 
         Console.WriteLine("Result is : {0}", dResult); 
      } 
      catch(ArithmeticException exArithmetic) 
      { 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught Arithmetic exception: {0}",  
                           exArithmetic.Message); 
      } 
      catch(DivideByZeroException exDivByZero) 
      { 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught Divide By Zero exception: {0}",    
                           exDivByZero.Message); 
      } 
      catch(Exception ex) 
      { 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: {0}", ex.Message); 
      } 
      finally 
      { 
         // Should always execute 
         Console.WriteLine("In finally"); 
      } 
   } 
} 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Imports System 
 
Module MyDecimalDivider 
 
   Sub Main() 
 
      Try 
 
         ' Trigger a divide by zero exception 
         Dim dResult as Decimal = Decimal.Divide(5,0) 
 
         ' We should never get here  
         Console.WriteLine("Result is : {0}", dResult) 
 
      Catch exArithmetic As ArithmeticException 
 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught Arithmetic exception: {0}", _   
           exArithmetic.Message) 
  
      Catch exDivByZero As DivideByZeroException   
 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught Divide By Zero exception: {0}", _ 
           exDivByZero.Message) 
 
      Catch ex As Exception  
 
         Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: {0}", ex.Message) 
 
      Finally  
 
         ' Should always execute 
         Console.WriteLine("In finally") 
 
      End Try 
 
   End Sub 
 
End Module 
 
 
 
Now save the file and compile the modified MyDecimalDivider.cs/ MyDecimalDivider.vb in 
the DOS command line using: 
 
Compiling in C# 
 
csc  /target:exe MyDecimalDivider.cs  
 
 
 
Compiling in VB.NET 
 
vbc  /target:exe  MyDecimalDivider.vb 
 
 
 
Run the application MyDecimalDivider.exe and observe the output: 
Output in C#  
MyDecimalDivider.cs(21,9): error CS0160: A previous catch clause already catches all exceptions of this or a super type 
('System.ArithmeticException') 
The error says it all. The ArithmeticException catch handler has been placed above the 
catch handler that handles exception types of its subclass DivideByZeroException, which 
effectively hides the catch handler for the DivideByZeroException.  
Output in VB.NET 
Caught Arithmetic exception: Attempted to divide by zero. 
In finally 
Since ArithmeticException‘s Catch handler has been placed above the Catch handler for its 
subclass exception type DivideByZeroException, the Catch handler for the ArithmeticException 
is asked to handle the error even though the actual exception type that was raised was 
DivideByZeroException.  
You’ll observe the same behavior if you place the System.Exception Catch handler above 
any of the other catch handlers. In order to give DivideByZeroException’s Catch handler the 
opportunity to handle the error, place it above the Catch handler that handles 
ArithmeticException exceptions (DivideByZeroException’s super class). To summarize, place 
Catch handler filters for specific exception types (sub classes) higher than the handlers for 
the more generic exception types (base classes). 
Code listing in C#  
// Rest of the code omitted for brevity . . . 
catch(DivideByZeroException exDivByZero) 
{ 
Console.WriteLine("Caught Divide By Zero exception: {0}", 
 exDivByZero.Message); 
} 
catch(ArithmeticException exArithmetic) 
{ 
Console.WriteLine("Caught Arithmetic exception: {0}", exArithmetic.Message); 
} 
catch(Exception ex) 
{  
Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: {0}", ex.Message); 
} 
Code listing in VB.NET 
Try 
// Rest of the code omitted for brevity . . . 
Catch exDivByZero As DivideByZeroException   
Console.WriteLine("Caught Divide By Zero exception: {0}",  _ 
 exDivByZero.Message) 
Catch exArithmetic As ArithmeticException 
Console.WriteLine("Caught Arithmetic exception: {0}", exArithmetic.Message) 
Catch ex As Exception  
Console.WriteLine("Caught exception: {0}", ex.Message) 
Finally  
' Should always execute 
Console.WriteLine("In finally") 
End Try 
Now let’s try one more thing. We’ll remove the catch handler for the 
DivideByZeroException, just leaving behind the catch handlers for the 
System.ArithmeticException and the System.Exception classes. 
Go ahead and modify the MyDecimalDivider code by commenting out the catch handler for 
the DivideByZeroException. Compile and run the application. What output do you see this 
time? 
Caught Arithmetic exception: Attempted to divide by zero. 
In finally 
As shown above, though there was no catch handler for the DivideByZeroException that 
was raised, the catch handler for ArithemeticException was able to catch the exception since 
the ArithemeticException class happens to be a base class of the DivideByZeroException 
class. Similarly, even if we didn’t have the catch handler for the ArithmeticException class, 
the System.Exception catch handler would have still caught the exception (since it’s the 
parent class for all exception types). So what happens if a DivideByZeroException is raised 
and you don’t have any of the catch handlers (not even the System.Exception catch 
handler)? . You guessed right – the exception would turn into an unhandled exception 
crashing your application. Try this by removing the try block and all the catch-finally 
handlers and call Decimal.Divide() by passing a value of 0 for the divisor and notice what 
happens: 
Output in C# 
Unhandled Exception: System.DivideByZeroException: Attempted to divide by zero. 
   at System.Decimal.Divide(Decimal d1, Decimal d2) 
   at MyDecimalDivider.Main(String[] args) 
Output in VB.NET 
Unhandled Exception: System.DivideByZeroException: Attempted to divide by zero. 
   at System.Decimal.Divide(Decimal d1, Decimal d2) 
   at MyDecimalDivider.Main() 
7.5 Handling exceptions that are not System.Exception 
compliant 
What happens when your managed .NET code interacts with legacy libraries that are 
.NET agnostic. In general cases, when you interact with unmanaged code using the 
Platform Invoke (P/Invoke) or COM Interoperability mechanisms provided by the .NET 
framework, an exception raised from unmanaged code would be mapped back by the 
CLR into an appropriate .NET exception type. However, there are cases where legacy 
unmanaged libraries could possibly raise exceptions that are not System.Exception 
compliant, which cannot be mapped to a corresponding .NET exception type. In such 
cases, you can use a generic exception handler that can catch errors that are not .NET 
aware and not compliant with System.Exception. The generic catch handler contains only 
the catch keyword and does not specify an exception type filter. Here’s an example code 
snippet with a generic catch handler: 
Code listing in C# 
try 
{ 
// This is the try block 
} 
catch(Exception ex) 
{ 
// This is the catch block to handle System.Exception errors 
} 
catch 
{ 
// This is a generic catch block to handle calls to libraries that raise    
 // exceptions which are not compliant with System.Exception. Can catch  
// any error that the other catch handlers cannot handle. 
} 
finally 
{ 
// This is the finally block 
} 
Code listing in VB.NET 
Try         
 ' This is the Try block 
Catch ex As Exception   
 ' This is the catch block to handle System.Exception errors 
Catch 
 ' This is a generic catch block to handle calls to libraries that raise      
' exceptions which are not compliant with System.Exception. Can catch     
' any error that the other catch handlers cannot handle. 
Finally         
  ' This is the finally block 
End Try 
7.6 Understanding Application exceptions (user-defined or 
custom exceptions) 
Though the FCL supports a great deal of predefined system exception classes (as seen in 
the earlier section) that can be used to represent a large gamut of errors, there is always a 
need to model custom errors that represent failed run-of-the-mill business logic as well as 
other application specific error scenarios. In these situations, you need to turn to defining 
your own custom exceptions that are application specific. When defining application 
specific custom exceptions, you need to typically create a class that is derived from the 
System.ApplicationException class.  
It is good practice and generally recommended that the application exception class be 
suffixed with Exception. For example, if you need to define an exception that indicates 
that a specific ticket to a movie is not available, you’d probably want to name it 
something like TicketNotAvailableException.  
So let’s put this in practice and see how to define and use a custom application exception. 
The example we’ll take up is a class that simulates a television channel changer, which 
allows the user to surf television channels. We’ll assume that one of our business logic 
constraints is that we support only 80 channels and that the class is expected to flip 
channels only if the user enters a channel number between 1 and 80. If the user enters an 
invalid channel number, the class is expected throw an application exception, which 
indicates that the channel number entered is invalid. So let’s put together this 
application-specific exception class.  
 
We’ll call the exception class ChannelNotAvailableException and derive this class from the 
System.ApplicationException class to indicate that this is an application specific exception. 
Next, we’ll have to create some constructors for this class. The best practice guidelines 
for exception handling recommend that we have two constructors in addition to the 
default no-argument constructor - One constructor that accepts the error message as a 
parameter and the other one that accepts both an error message and an inner exception as 
a parameter. Let’s take a look at the ChannelNotAvailableException class. 
 
Code listing in C# 
 
class ChannelNotAvailableException : System.ApplicationException 
{ 
   public ChannelNotAvailableException() 
   { 
   } 
 
   public ChannelNotAvailableException(String errorMessage) :  
                                                       base(errorMessage) 
   { 
   } 
    
   public ChannelNotAvailableException(String errorMessage, 
          Exception innerException)  : base(errorMessage, innerException)  
   { 
   } 
} 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Public Class ChannelNotAvailableException 
     Inherits ApplicationException 
    
   ' Default Constructor 
   Public Sub New() 
     
      ' Call the base class constructor 
      MyBase.New() 
       
   End Sub 
 
 
   ' Constructor that takes message string 
   Public Sub New(ByVal errorMessage As String) 
 
      ' Call the base class constructor 
      MyBase.New(errorMessage) 
 
   End Sub 
 
 
   ' Constructor that takes message string and inner exception 
   Public Sub New(ByVal errorMessage As String,  _ 
                  ByVal innerException As Exception) 
 
      ' Call the base class constructor 
      MyBase.New(errorMessage, innerException) 
 
   End Sub 
 
End Class 
 
 
 
 
The ChannelNotAvailableException class shown above is fairly trivial and you’ll notice that 
the non-default constructors do nothing more than initializing their corresponding base 
class counter parts through the base class argument-list initializer. That’s it – we’re done 
setting up our custom exception class. We’ll see how to put this to use in our TV channel 
surfer application. Let’s put together some code for the channel surfer class.  
 
Code listing in C# 
 
class ChannelSurfer 
{ 
 
   private const int MAX_CHANNELS = 80; 
   private int m_nCurrentChannel; 
 
   ChannelSurfer() 
   { 
      // Set channel 1 as the default 
      m_nCurrentChannel = 1; 
   } 
 
   public int CurrentChannel 
   { 
      get  
      { 
         // Return the current channel 
         return m_nCurrentChannel; 
      } 
   } 
 
   // Rest of the class implementation goes here . . . 
} 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Public Class ChannelSurfer 
 
   Private Const MAX_CHANNELS As Integer = 80 
   Private m_nCurrentChannel As Integer 
     
   Public Sub New() 
 
      MyBase.New() 
 
      ' Set channel 1 as the default 
      Me.m_nCurrentChannel = 1 
 
   End Sub 
 
    
   ReadOnly Property CurrentChannel() As Integer 
     
      Get 
         ' Return the current channel 
         Return Me.m_nCurrentChannel 
      End Get 
 
   End Property 
 
 
   ' Rest of the class implementation goes here . . . 
 
 
End Class 
 
 
 
The channel surfer class supports a read-only property named CurrentChannel that keeps 
track of the current channel being viewed. The viewer can move between channels by 
calling the FlipToChannel() method shown below: 
 
Code listing in C# 
 
class ChannelSurfer 
{ 
 
   // Rest of the class implementation goes here . . . 
 
   void FlipToChannel(int nChannelNumber) 
   { 
      if( (nChannelNumber < 1) ||  (nChannelNumber > MAX_CHANNELS)) 
      { 
         throw new ChannelNotAvailableException("We support only 80 channels."  
                     +  "Please enter a number between 1 and 80"); 
      } 
      else 
      { 
         // Set the value of the current channel 
         m_nCurrentChannel = nChannelNumber; 
      } 
   } 
  
} 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Public Class ChannelSurfer 
 
   ' Rest of the class implementation goes here . . . 
 
   Sub FlipToChannel(ByVal nChannel As Integer) 
 
      If ((nChannel < 1) Or (nChannel > MAX_CHANNELS)) Then 
 
        ' Raise an exception  
        Throw New ChannelNotAvailableException("We support only 80 channels." _  
                 +  "Please enter a number between 1 and 80") 
      Else 
 
         ' Set the current channel 
         Me.m_nCurrentChannel = nChannel 
 
      End If 
 
   End Sub 
 
End Class 
 
 
 
As seen above the FlipToChannel() method checks to  see if  the channel number that the 
user is requesting is between 1 and 80 and if so, sets the value of the CurrentChannel 
property to the requested channel. If the values are not within the specified range, the 
class throws the user-defined ChannelNotAvailableException exception. Let’s use the 
application’s Main() entry point as a test harness for the ChannelSurfer class. Take a look 
at the code below:

class ChannelSurfer 
{ 
 
   // Rest of the class implementation goes here . . . 
 
   static void Main(string[] args) 
   { 
      ChannelSurfer channelZapper = new ChannelSurfer(); 
 
      // Display a message 
      Console.WriteLine("Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit zapping channels"); 
 
      // Set up an infinite loop 
      for(;;) 
      { 
         try 
         { 
            // It's channel surfing time folks! 
            Console.Write("Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter'"); 
 
            // Get the channel number from the user 
            String strChannel = Console.ReadLine(); 
 
            // Check if the user wants to quit 
            if(strChannel.Equals("Q") || strChannel.Equals("q")) break; 
 
            // Convert the channel number to an integer 
            int nChannel = Int32.Parse(strChannel); 
 
            // Flip away to the requested channel 
            channelZapper.FlipToChannel(nChannel); 
         } 
         catch(ChannelNotAvailableException exChannel) 
         { 
            Console.WriteLine("Channel not supported: {0}", exChannel.Message); 
         } 
         catch(FormatException exFormat) 
         { 
            Console.WriteLine("Caught a format exception: {0}",  
                               exFormat.Message);

         { 
            Console.WriteLine("Caught a exception: {0}", ex.Message); 
         } 
         finally 
         { 
            // What channel are we watching? 
            Console.WriteLine("You are watching Channel : {0}", 
                               channelZapper.CurrentChannel); 
         } 
      } 
   } 
}

            Console.WriteLine("Channel not supported: {0}", _

The Main() entry point creates an instance of the ChannelSurfer class and sets up a loop 
that requests channel numbers from the user until the user presses the ‘Q’ or ‘q’ key to 
quit the application. When the channel number input is received, it calls the 
FlipToChannel() method of the ChannelSurfer object. The FlipToChannel() method call is 
enclosed within a try block and an appropriate catch handler for the 
ChannelNotAvailableException will catch the exception if an invalid channel number is 
passed to the FlipToChannel() method. Also, if the user enters non-numeric input, the 
Int32.Parse() method will throw a System.FormatException that will be caught by the catch 
handler that we’ve setup to handle FormatException exceptions. 
 
Compile the file using the following command from the DOS command line: 
 
Compiling in C# 
 
csc  /target:exe ChannelSurfer.cs 
 
 
 
Compiling in VB.NET 
 
vbc  /target:exe ChannelSurfer.vb 
 
 
 
That generates the executable file ChannelSurfer.exe. Run the application and feed it with 
input containing both valid and invalid input values. Here’s a sample interaction with the 
ChannelSurfer application. 
Press 'Q' or 'q' to quit zapping channels 
Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter' 62 
You are watching Channel : 62 
Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter' 56 
You are watching Channel : 56 
Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter' 104 
Channel not supported: We support only 80 channels. Please enter a number between 1 
and 80 
You are watching Channel : 56 
Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter' abcd 
Caught a format exception : Input string was not in a correct format. 
You are watching Channel : 56 
Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter' 15 
You are watching Channel : 15 
Please enter a channel number and press 'Enter' q 
You are watching Channel : 15 
You will notice from the output above that when the user enters 104 for the channel 
number, the ChannelNotAvailableException is thrown from the FlipToChannel() method, 
which is then handled by the catch handler. Similarly, when the user keys in a 
non-numeric value such as abcd, a System.FormatException is raised by the Int32.Parse() 
method, which then gets caught by the catch handler that filters the FormatException 
exceptions.  Using application specific exceptions like ChannelNotAvailableException 
allows you to build exception-handling classes around your business-logic and 
application specific scenarios. Be sure to check if the framework provides a predefined 
exception class that suits the exception type that you want to handle. If so, reuse FCL 
provided system exceptions. Otherwise, feel free to model custom exception classes that 
are modeled around application specific exception scenarios. 
7.7 Nesting try/catch/finally blocks and re-throwing exceptions 
It should be noted that structured exception handling allows you to nest try/catch/finally 
blocks within one another. This allows multiple levels of nesting and if the inner catch 
blocks cannot handle a specific exception type, the runtime will look for a matching catch 
handler in one of the outer try blocks. This repeats until a matching catch handler is found 
in one of the enclosing blocks. If the outermost try block is reached and no such matching 
catch handler is found, the runtime forces an unhandled exception to be raised. Let’s take 
a look at a quick example of how to nest try/catch/finally blocks within one another. 
Code listing in C# 
using System; 
 
class HelloNested 
{ 
   static void Main(string[] args) 
   { 
      try 
      { 
         try 
         { 
            throw new Exception("It's just too warm in here !"); 
         } 
         catch(Exception exInner) 
         { 
            // Display the exception message 
            Console.WriteLine("Inner catch caught an exception: {0}", 
                               exInner.Message); 
         } 
         finally 
         { 
            // The inner finally block that executes always 
            Console.WriteLine("Inner finally"); 
         } 
 
         // Continue execution in the Outer try block 
         Console.WriteLine("Continue executing in Outer ..."); 
 
      } 
      catch(Exception exOuter) 
      { 
         // Display the exception message 
         Console.WriteLine("Outer catch caught an exception: {0}", 
                            exOuter.Message); 
      } 
      finally 
      { 
         // The outer finally block that executes always 
         Console.WriteLine("Outer finally"); 
      } 
   } 
} 
 
 
 
Code listing in VB.NET 
 
Imports System 
 
 
Module HelloNested 
 
   Sub Main() 
 
 
      ' This is the beginning of the Outer Try block 
      Try 
 
         ' This is the beginning of the Inner Try block 
         Try 
 
            Throw New Exception("It's just too warm in here !")

          exInner.Message)

            Console.WriteLine("Inner finally") 
 
 
        ' The Inner Try/Catch/Finally blocks ends here

        ' Continue execution in the Outer try block 
        Console.WriteLine("Continue executing in Outer ...") 
 
 
      Catch exOuter As Exception 
 
         ' Display the exception message 
         Console.WriteLine("Outer catch caught an exception: {0}", _ 
                            exOuter.Message) 
 
 
      Finally 
 
         ' The outer finally clause that executes always

    End Sub 
 
End Module 
 
 
 
As shown in the example above, we have an inner try/catch/finally triad nested within an 
outer try block. The code within the inner try block raises an exception, so the runtime 
will check to see if one of the inner catch handlers will be able to handle the exception. 
Only when none of the inner catch handlers can handle that exception type, will the catch 
handlers of the outer try block be examined if they’ll be able to handle the error.  
 
Save the example shown above in a file named HelloNested.cs/HelloNested.vb. Compile the 
application by running the following command from the DOS command line: 
 
Compiling in C# 
 
csc  /target:exe HelloNested.cs 
 
 
Compiling in VB.NET 
vbc  /target:exe HelloNested.vb 
Run the program HelloNested.exe and observe the output: 
Inner catch caught an exception : It's just too warm in here ! 
Inner finally 
Continue executing in Outer ... 
Outer finally 
As seen from the output above, the inner catch handler catches an exception raised by the 
code in the inner try block since it can handle System.Exception exceptions. Now replace 
the inner catch block in the above example to handle only System.OverflowException 
exceptions. 
Code listing in C# 
catch(OverflowException exInner) 
{ 
// Display the exception message 
Console.WriteLine("Inner catch caught an exception: {0}", exInner.Message); 
} 
Code listing in VB.NET 
Catch exOverflow As OverflowException 
 ' Display the exception message 
Console.WriteLine("Inner catch caught an overflow exception: {0}", _ 
exOverflow.Message) 
Compile and run the modified program HelloNested.exe and observe the output: 
Inner finally 
Outer catch caught an exception : It's just too warm in here ! 
Outer finally 
Notice that since the inner catch block can handle only System.OverflowException 
exceptions the runtime looks for a matching catch handler in the outer blocks and locates 
the outer catch handler, which subsequently handles the System.Exception exception. 
Until now, we’ve seen how exceptions are raised by code enclosed within the try block. 
But also take note that you can throw exceptions from within catch and finally blocks too. 
There are times when a catch handler catches an exception and examines it only to find 
that it cannot handle the exception. In such cases, the catch handler can re-throw the 
exception hoping that one of the outer catch handlers will be able to catch the exception 
and handle it appropriately. In this case, the runtime checks for a matching catch handler 
in one of the enclosing outer catch blocks to handle the re-thrown exception. Let’s modify 
the earlier example to re-throw the exception that we caught in the inner catch block. 
Modify the inner catch block in the HelloNested code as shown below:

      // Display the exception message 
      Console.WriteLine("Inner catch caught an exception: {0}", 
                         exInner.Message); 
 
      // Rethrow the exception 
      throw exInner; 
   } 
   finally 
   { 
      // The inner finally block that executes always 
      Console.WriteLine("Inner finally"); 
   } 
 
   // Continue execution in the Outer try block 
   Console.WriteLine("Continue executing in Outer ..."); 
} 
 
// Rest of the code omitted for brevity . . .

Try 
 
   Throw New Exception("It's just too warm in here !") 
 
Catch exInner As Exception 
           
   ' Display the exception message 
   Console.WriteLine("Inner catch caught an exception: {0}", exInner.Message) 
 
 
 ' Rethrow the exception 
Throw exOverflow 
Finally 
 ' The inner finally clause that executes always 
Console.WriteLine("Inner finally") 
 ' The Inner Try/Catch/Finally blocks ends here  
End Try 
' Rest of the code omitted for brevity . . . 
You will notice that the inner catch block re-throws the exception that it catches and 
hopes that one of the outer catch handlers will be able to handle it. Compile and run the 
application. Observe the output: 
Inner catch caught an exception : It's just too warm in here ! 
Inner finally 
Outer catch caught an exception : It's just too warm in here ! 
Outer finally 
You’ll notice that both the inner and the outer catch handlers have a go at handling the 
exception. The inner catch block catches the exception and re-throws it. The re-thrown 
exception is then subsequently caught and handled by the outer catch handler. Take note 
that you can throw exceptions from finally blocks too. 
How the CLR uses the call-stack to locate a matching catch handler: 
When an exception occurs, the CLR tries to locate an appropriate catch handler 
(associated with the current try block), which is capable of handling the exception. If it 
cannot find an appropriate catch handler, then the next outer try-catch block is examined 
for appropriate catch handlers. This search continues until it finds a matching catch 
handler within the scope of the currently executing method (in C#) / procedure (in 
VB.NET). If it still cannot find a matching catch handler within the scope of the currently 
executing method/procedure, it pops the current method/procedure out of the call-stack 
thus causing the current method to lose scope, and then searches for matching catch 
handlers in the next method (the method that had originally called the current 
method/procedure) in the call-stack. If it cannot find a matching catch handler there too, it 
pops this method/procedure out and examines the next one in the call-stack. This stack 
unwinding continues until a matching catch handler is found for the exception that was 
thrown. If no such matching catch handler is found when the stack is completely 
unwound, then the exception becomes an unhandled exception.

In the above code fragment, the Main() entry point in the program calls the DiveIn() 
method (in C#) / Subroutine (in VB.NET), which in turn calls the DiveDeeper() 
method/subroutine. Notice that the DiveDeeper() method throws a custom 
application-defined exception called SharkAttackException. 
 
Explanation using C# 
Explanation using VB.NET 
When the SharkAttackException exception is thrown the CLR checks to see if the catch 
handlers associated with the try block in DiveDeeper() can handle the exception Since the 
only exception type handled by the catch handler in DiveDeeper() happens to be 
OutOfOxygenException, the CLR will pop the DiveDeeper() method out of the stack after 
executing the finally block in DiveDeeper(). It will then go on to search for a suitable catch 
handler in the next method/procedure in the call-stack, which happens to be the DiveIn() 
method/subroutine. Since the try-catch block in the DiveIn() method also happens to have 
a catch handler that handles only WaterTooColdException exceptions, this method/procedure 
is also popped out of the call-stack after executing its finally block. The Main() 
method/subroutine, which is the next in the call-stack is then examined for matching 
catch handler within the try-catch block. As you can see, the try-catch block within the 
Main() method/subroutine does have a catch handler that can handle the 
SharkAttackException and so control is eventually passed over to this catch handler after 
which the corresponding finally block is executed. Assuming that the Main() entry-point 
method/subroutine did not have an appropriate catch handler too, then the next pop 
operation would have completely unwound the call-stack thereby making the 
SharkAttackException an unhandled exception 
Catching arithmetic overflow exceptions with C#’s checked keyword: 
Never ever discount the destructive effects that arithmetic overflow exceptions bring to 
the stability of your software. For starters, recollect the tragic crash of the $7 billion 
Ariane 5 rocket  – A crash that resulted because its software system attempted to convert 
a 64-bit floating-point number to a signed 16-bit integer, which subsequently caused an 
overflow exception, and worse yet, there was no exception handler to handle this 
exception. Sadly enough, the backup systems were also running on the same copy of the 
software, without the exception handler. Read an account of the Ariane 5 crash at: 
http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/courses/230/ariane5nyt.pdf
Let’s face it – How many times have we been in situations where we’ve stared in 
disbelief at our program spewing some insanely odd numerical output on arithmetic 
operations when it’s fairly obvious that the output is in not even slightly connected to 
what was expected of the program. Let’s quickly see what we mean here with an 
example. Consider the following C# program: 
using System; 
class ByteBites 
{ 
static void Main(string[] args) 
{ 
 byte b1 = 57; 
 byte b2 = 200; 
byte bResult = (byte)(b1 + b2); 
Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", b1, b2, bResult); 
} 
} 
Save this program to a file called ByteBites.cs.  Compile the program using the following 
command from the DOS command line: 
csc  /target:exe ByteBites.cs 
Run ByteBites.exe and observe the output: 
57 + 200 = 1 
Many of us know what went wrong here. It’s fairly obvious here that a byte data type can 
hold only values from 0 to 255. Yet we are trying to add two bytes whose result over 
shoots the range of values that the resultant byte can hold, resulting in an overflow, and 
hence the absurd result 1. This is what the less wary among us (at least I do) run into 
when choosing data types to work with, paying little attention to the range of data that the 
program expects these data types to store and handle. A subtle arithmetic addition 
operation that has the potential to generate an overflow operation is enough to send your 
application to the tomb. Most often, good testing practices catch these bugs during the 
testing phase. But it certainly might get past the QA team if the test data being fed to the 
program is not very exhaustive and if every possible test case is not being taken into 
account – The Ariane 5 crash of 1996 is a testimony to that. So as developers, we need to 
code defensively to catch such arithmetic overflow errors and handle them appropriately 
in the execution flow of the program as our application logic dictates, thus leaving no 
room for inconsistent or incorrect results to bring down the application to a grinding halt. 
So let’s see where C# can help us here. C# provides the checked keyword to trap and 
handle such arithmetic overflows. When an arithmetic operation that is enclosed within a 
checked block (or checked expression) results in an overflow, the runtime generates a 
System.OverflowException. Compare this to our previous example where the overflow 
result was silently assigned to the resulting byte. So let’s modify the previous example to 
enclose the arithmetic addition of the two bytes within a checked block. The modified 
code is shown below: 
using System; 
class ByteBites 
{ 
static void Main(string[] args) 
{ 
 try 
 { 
checked 
{ 
 byte b1 = 57; 
 byte b2 = 200; 
byte bResult = (byte)(b1 + b2); 
 Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", b1, b2, bResult); 
  } 
 } 
 catch(OverflowException exOverflow) 
 { 
Console.WriteLine("Caught overflow exception: {0}", 
exOverflow.Message); 
 } 
} 
} 
You’ll notice that we now have a checked block that encloses the arithmetic operation, 
which in turn is enclosed within a try block. Compile and run the application. Notice the 
output: 
Caught overflow exception: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow. 
You’ll notice that the addition operation generated a System.OverflowException because it 
was enclosed within a checked block. Remove the checked block and you’ll notice that 
you’ll again get back the cryptic 1 as the result. But then, wouldn’t it be asking too much 
if we had to put each and every arithmetic operation that had the potential to generate an 
overflow within a checked block. Thankfully, there’s an easier way to turn on arithmetic 
overflow checking for the entire application by using the /checked compiler option when 
compiling your application. To test this, go ahead and remove the checked block that is 
enclosing the addition operation. This time compile the program with the /checked switch 
turned on, by typing the following command in the DOS command line: 
csc  /target:exe /checked ByteBites.cs 
Run the program and observe the output that the program spews out: 
Caught overflow exception: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow. 
Notice that the /checked option has the same effect as using the checked block around your 
arithmetic operations. This option thereby allows you to enforce arithmetic overflow 
checks and to catch such exceptions throughout your application. So what if you’ve 
turned on the /checked option and want to selectively prevent certain parts in your 
application from generating an overflow exception when an overflow occurs. For 
example, assume you have a scenario where you need the check the value of the 
overflowed result to determine what action to take and so on. In such cases, you can use 
the unchecked keyword and enclose those arithmetic operations within an unchecked 
block so that an OverflowException is not generated for those operations. This is shown in 
the snippet of code below: 
unchecked 
{ 
byte b1 = 57; 
byte b2 = 200; 
byte bResult = (byte)(b1 + b2); 
Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", b1, b2, bResult); 
} 
Of course, the above code fragment gives you yet another opportunity to see the 
infamous 1 as the result.  
Using the checked keyword and /checked compiler option judiciously in your C# 
applications can help you catch arithmetic overflow exceptions and to ensure that your 
application stays sane. 
7.8 Parting thoughts… 
It has always been our tendency to put together our application’s functional capabilities 
in leaps and bounds paying little attention to analyzing where those functional 
capabilities could possibly go wrong during execution and to handle those error 
conditions appropriately. Today’s software systems are increasingly expected to meet 
high levels of fault tolerance and reliability. To meet that objective, we need to adopt 
effective exception and error handling strategies in our applications to trap errors and to 
recover from them gracefully. The C#/VB.NET language supports powerful constructs to 
handle exceptions in our applications. Hopefully, this tutorial gave you an introduction on 
how to use those constructs in your applications to handle errors and exceptions. Put 
them to good use and you’ll be well on your way to writing robust, fault tolerant, and 
reliable applications.  
8. Assemblies and Application Domains 
Section Owner: Akila Manian (MVP)

8.1 Introduction 
In Microsoft .NET, when an application is compiled, the output of the compilation 
produces what is known as an Assembly. Two types of assemblies can be produced by the 
compilation procedure. One is the executable file (*.exe) and the other is a dynamic link 
library file (*.dll). Basically the assembly is the unit of deployment in Microsoft .NET 
and it can be thought of as a collection of types and resources that form a logical unit of 
functionality. 
An assembly is a self-describing entity. It contains all information about the types 
(classes) contained in the assembly, all external references needed for executing the 
assembly and so on. This is possible with an assembly manifest. The manifest contains 
assembly’s identity and version information, a file table containing all files that make up 
the assembly and the assembly reference list for all external dependencies. Thus 
assemblies do not need to depend on the registry values for compilation or execution.  
An assembly contains manifest data and one or more modules. Manifest data contains 
information about the assembly and other list of assemblies that it depends on. It also 
contains all the publicly exposed types and resources. An assembly contains various 
modules. Each module contains metadata and IL.  
Assemblies can be viewed by application developers with the help of a tool called ildasm 
(IL Disassembler) provided by the .NET Framework.   
8.2 Assembly Types 
Assemblies can be single file assemblies or multi file assemblies. In multi file assemblies 
one of the files must contain the assembly’s manifest data. Multi file assemblies can have 
only one entry point even though the assembly can contain multiple code modules. A 
multi file assembly is created primarily for combining modules written in different 
programming languages.  Once the assembly is created, the file that contains the 
assembly manifest (and hence the assembly) can be signed, or one can give the file (and 
the assembly) a strong name and put it in the global assembly cache. 
Main uses of multi file assembly are for combining modules written in different 
programming languages. They enable optimization of downloading an application by 
putting seldom-used types in a module that is downloaded only when needed. The .NET 
Framework downloads a file only when it is referenced; keeping infrequently referenced 
code in a separate file from the application optimizes code download. 
Let us look at an example of how to create multi file assembly. 
AddModule.cs 
Copy and Paste the following code into Notepad and save it as  or AddModule.vb, 
depending on the language that you are using 
Code Listing in C# 
using System; 
public class AddClass 
{ 
  public int Add(int Operand1, int Operand2) 
  { 
 return Operand1 + Operand2; 
 } 
} 
Compiling in C# 
/Compilation csc /r:System.dll /t:Module AddModule.cs 
Code Listing in VB.NET 
Imports System 
Public Module AddModule 
 Public Class AddClass 
  Function Add(ByVal Operand1 As Integer, ByVal Operand2 As Integer) As Integer 
 Add = Operand1 + Operand2 
  End Function 
 End Class 
End Module 
Compiling in VB.NET 
vbc /r:System.dll /t:Module AddModule.vb 
 
 
This file is compiled with the target option as module. Hence an assembly is not created. 
The output is a file with an extension of  .netmodule.  
 
 
Similarly create SubtractModule.cs/ as shown below 
 
 
SubtractModule.vb 
 
Code Listing in C# 
using System; 
 
   public class SubtractClass 
   { 
      public int Subtract(int Operand1 , int Operand2 ) 
      { 
         return  Operand1 - Operand2; 
      } 
   } 
 
 
Compiling in C# 
csc /r:System.dll /t:Module SubtractModule.cs 
 
 
Code Listing in VB.NET 
Imports System 
Public Module SubtractModule 
   Public Class SubtractClass 
      Function Subtract(ByVal Operand1 As Integer, ByVal Operand2 As Integer) As 
Integer 
         Subtract = Operand1 - Operand2 
      End Function 
   End Class 
End Module 
 
 
Compiling in VB.NET 
vbc /r:System.dll /t:Module SubtractModule.vb 
 
 
Now create the main module, which references the above modules. The code is as shown 
below for MainModule.cs/MainModule.vb 
 
MainModule.cs 
 
Code Listing in C# 
using System; 
public class MainModule 
{ 
    public static void  Main() 
    { 
 int iOperand1, iOperand2, iResult ; 
  
 iOperand1 = 22; 
 iOperand2 = 11; 
 iResult = 0; 
  
     AddClass objAddClass = New AddClass(); 
     SubtractClass objSubtractClass = New SubtractClass(); 
      
     iResult = objAddClass.Add(iOperand1, iOperand2); 
     Console.WriteLine(iResult.ToString()); 
      
     iResult = objSubtractClass.Subtract(iOperand1, iOperand2); 
     Console.WriteLine(iResult.ToString()); 
     Console.ReadLine(); 
    } 
} 
 
 
Compiling in C# 
Compilation csc /r:System.dll MainModule.cs 
 
 
 
Code Listing in VB.NET 
 
Imports System 
Public Module MainModule 
    Sub Main() 
 Dim iOperand1, iOperand2, iResult As Integer 
  
 iOperand1 = 22 
 iOperand2 = 11 
 iResult = 0 
  
     Dim objAddClass As New AddClass 
     Dim objSubtractClass As New SubtractClass 
      
     iResult = objAddClass.Add(iOperand1, iOperand2) 
     Console.WriteLine(iResult.ToString) 
      
     iResult = objSubtractClass.Subtract(iOperand1, iOperand2) 
     Console.WriteLine(iResult.ToString) 
     Console.ReadLine() 
    End Sub 
End Module 
 
 
Compiling in VB.NET 
vbc /r:System.dll MainModule.vb 
 
 
 
 
The code is compiled as follows  
 
To create a multi file assemble, which contains the two modules created previously 
namely AddModule and SubtractModule, compile using the following command at the 
command prompt 
 
Compiling in C# 
csc /System.dll /addModule:AddModule.netmodule 
/addModule:SubtractModule.netmodule MainModule.cs 
 
Compiling in VB.NET 
Vbc /System.dll /addModule:AddModule.netmodule 
/addModule:SubtractModule.netmodule MainModule.vb 
 
This process creates a multi file assembly. This assembly contains the two modules 
created previously namely AddModule and SubtractModule. Thus this assembly contains 
multiple modules. If ildasm utility is executed on the MainModule assembly, it shows 
that the manifest information in the MainModule contains references to the AddModule 
and the SubtractModule modules. That is the modules are linked to the main assembly by 
the information contained in the main assembly’s manifest information. 
8.3 Private Assemblies 
A private assembly is an assembly that is deployed with an application and is available 
only for that application. That is, other applications do not share the private assembly. 
Private assemblies are installed in a folder of the application's directory structure. 
Typically, this is the folder containing the application's executable file.  
For most .NET Framework applications, you keep the assemblies that make up an 
application in the application's directory, in a subdirectory of the application's directory. 
You can override where the CLR looks for an assembly by using the <codeBase> 
element in a configuration file.  
8.4 Shared Assemblies 
A shared assembly is an assembly available for use by multiple applications on the 
computer. To make the assembly global, it has to be put into the Global Assembly Cache. 
Each computer where the common language runtime is installed has a machine-wide 
code cache called the global assembly cache. The global assembly cache stores 
assemblies specifically for sharing by several applications on the computer.  
You should share assemblies by installing them into the global assembly cache only 
when you need to. As a general guideline, keep assembly dependencies private and locate 
assemblies in the application directory unless sharing an assembly is explicitly required.  
This is achieved with the help of a global assembly cache tool (gacutil.exe) provided by 
the .NET Framework. One can also drag & drop the assemblies into the Global Assembly 
Cache directory. 
However, when an assembly has to be put into the Global Assembly Cache it needs to be 
signed with a strong name. A strong name contains the assembly's identity i.e. it’s text 
name, version number, and culture information strengthened by a public key and a digital 
signature generated over the assembly. This is because the CLR verifies the strong name 
signature when the assembly is placed in the Global Assembly Cache.  
8.5 Application Domains 
Introduction 
Traditionally when many applications are executed on the same machine, they are 
isolated by something known as process. Ideally each application is loaded in its own 
process also known as address space. This isolation is need so that these applications do 
not tamper with other applications either intentionally or accidentally. Isolating 
applications is also important for application security. For example, one can run controls 
from several Web applications in a single browser process in such a way that the controls 
cannot access each other's data and resources.  
There are however many instances in which one would like an application to have the 
ability to communicate with other applications. Since these applications are loaded into 
different address spaces, there must be some form of context switching needed to allow 
one application to communicate with another. Inter process communication has to rely on 
operating systems support to manage this context switching and it is generally an 
expensive operation. Context switching means saving a process's context, it could also 
mean swapping the process out to virtual memory (to the page file stored on disk). If a 
single machine has a large number of active processes, the CPU is often reduced to 
swapping processes in and out of memory continuously, a phenomenon known as 
thrashing.  
Application Domains 
There should be a method by which the different applications can be executed in isolation 
from each other and which would also allow these applications to communicate with each 
other in a better way than offered by context switching. Microsoft .NET has introduced 
the Application Domain concept for precisely this reason. Application domains provide a 
secure and versatile unit of processing that the CLR can use to provide isolation between 
applications. Further, one can specify custom security policies on an Application Domain 
to ensure that codes run in an extremely strict and controlled app domain. One can run 
several application domains in a single process with the same level of isolation that 
would exist in separate processes, but without incurring the additional overhead of 
context switching between the processes. In Microsoft .NET, code normally passes a 
verification process before it can be executed. This code is considered as type-safe code 
and this allows CLR to provide a great level of isolation at the process level. Type-safe 
codes have less chances of causing memory faults. 
Code running in one application should not directly access code or resources from 
another application. The CLR enforces this isolation by preventing direct calls between 
objects in different application domains. Objects that pass between domains are either 
copied or accessed by proxy. If the object is copied, the call to the object is local. That is, 
both the caller and the object being referenced are in the same application domain. If the 
object is accessed through a proxy, the call to the object is remote. In this case, the caller 
and the object being referenced are in different application domains. As such, the 
metadata for the object being referenced must be available to both application domains to 
allow the method call to be JIT-compiled properly. 
Application Domains And Assemblies 
Before an assembly can be executed, it must be loaded into an application domain. By 
default, the CLR loads an assembly into an application domain containing the code that 
references it. In this way the assembly’s data and code are isolated to the application 
using it. In case, multiple application domains reference an assembly, the assembly’s 
code is shared amongst the different application domains. Such an assembly is said to be 
domain-neutral. An assembly is not shared between domains when it is granted a 
different set of permissions in each domain. This can occur if the runtime host sets an 
application domain-level security policy. Assemblies should not be loaded as domain
neutral if the set of permissions granted to the assembly is to be different in each domain. 
Programming with Application Domains 
Application domains are normally automatically created and managed by runtime hosts. 
However, Microsoft .NET also provides control to application developers to create and 
manage their own application domains. This would allow the developers to have control 
over loading and unloading the assemblies in different domains for performance reasons 
and maintain a high degree of isolation. Note that individual assemblies cannot be 
unloaded, the entire app domain has to be unloaded. 
If development is being carried out with some code or components downloaded from the 
Internet, running it in its own application domain provides an excellent way to isolate the 
rest of the applications from this code.  
The System namespace contains the class AppDomain. This class contains methods to 
create an application domain, to load and unload assemblies in the application domain.  
An example will be useful to illustrate how application domains can be created and 
assemblies loaded and unloaded into the application domains.  Note that only those 
assemblies that have been declared as Public can be loaded at runtime.

8.6 Conclusion 
 
Thus in this article we have seen what assemblies are in Microsoft .NET. We have seen 
single file and multi file assemblies. We have also seen private and public assemblies. 
We have also taken a look at application domains and how they are supported in .NET. 
Application domains offer all the benefits of process isolation, but are much more 
efficient than processes. The Microsoft .NET runtime host automatically manages the 
loading / unloading of the assemblies into the appropriate application domains. However, 
Microsoft .NET Framework class library also offers application developers with various 
classes that can be used to programmatically create application domains and ensure that 
the various applications can be isolated from each other. Also the inter-application 
communication is not that expensive because context switching is not involved in 
application communication using application domains in Microsoft .NET.
